ALICE=E2=80=99S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

Lewis Carroll

THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0




CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
it, =E2=80=98and what is the use of a book,=E2=80=99 thought Alice =E2=80=
=98without pictures or
conversations?=E2=80=99

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, =E2=80=98Oh dear=
!
Oh dear! I shall be late!=E2=80=99 (when she thought it over afterwards, it
occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
she passed; it was labelled =E2=80=98ORANGE MARMALADE=E2=80=99, but to her =
great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
she fell past it.

=E2=80=98Well!=E2=80=99 thought Alice to herself, =E2=80=98after such a fal=
l as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they=E2=80=99ll all think =
me at
home! Why, I wouldn=E2=80=99t say anything about it, even if I fell off the=
 top
of the house!=E2=80=99 (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! =E2=80=98I wonder ho=
w
many miles I=E2=80=99ve fallen by this time?=E2=80=99 she said aloud. =E2=
=80=98I must be getting
somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
thousand miles down, I think--=E2=80=99 (for, you see, Alice had learnt sev=
eral
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
=E2=80=98--yes, that=E2=80=99s about the right distance--but then I wonder =
what Latitude
or Longitude I=E2=80=99ve got to?=E2=80=99 (Alice had no idea what Latitude=
 was, or
Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. =E2=80=98I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH =
the
earth! How funny it=E2=80=99ll seem to come out among the people that walk =
with
their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--=E2=80=99 (she was rather g=
lad
there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn=E2=80=99t sound at all th=
e
right word) =E2=80=98--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the co=
untry
is, you know. Please, Ma=E2=80=99am, is this New Zealand or Australia?=E2=
=80=99 (and
she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you=E2=80=99re falli=
ng
through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) =E2=80=98And what an
ignorant little girl she=E2=80=99ll think me for asking! No, it=E2=80=99ll =
never do to
ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.=E2=80=99

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. =E2=80=98Dinah=E2=80=99ll miss me very much to-night, I shou=
ld think!=E2=80=99
(Dinah was the cat.) =E2=80=98I hope they=E2=80=99ll remember her saucer of=
 milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
mice in the air, I=E2=80=99m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that=E2=
=80=99s very
like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?=E2=80=99 And here A=
lice
began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
sort of way, =E2=80=98Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?=E2=80=99 and some=
times, =E2=80=98Do
bats eat cats?=E2=80=99 for, you see, as she couldn=E2=80=99t answer either=
 question,
it didn=E2=80=99t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was d=
ozing
off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, =E2=80=98Now, Dinah, tell me the t=
ruth:
did you ever eat a bat?=E2=80=99 when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came=
 upon
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and
was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, =E2=80=98Oh my ears
and whiskers, how late it=E2=80=99s getting!=E2=80=99 She was close behind =
it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice=E2=80=99=
s
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage
into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
doorway; =E2=80=98and even if my head would go through,=E2=80=99 thought po=
or Alice, =E2=80=98it
would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.=E2=
=80=99
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, [=E2=80=98which certainly was not her=
e
before,=E2=80=99 said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words =E2=80=98DRINK ME=E2=80=99 beautifully printed on it =
in large
letters.

It was all very well to say =E2=80=98Drink me,=E2=80=99 but the wise little=
 Alice was
not going to do THAT in a hurry. =E2=80=98No, I=E2=80=99ll look first,=E2=
=80=99 she said, =E2=80=98and
see whether it=E2=80=99s marked =E2=80=9Cpoison=E2=80=9D or not=E2=80=99; f=
or she had read several nice
little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild
beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember
the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot
poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked =E2=80=98poison,=E2=
=80=99 it is
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this bottle was NOT marked =E2=80=98poison,=E2=80=99 so Alice vent=
ured to taste
it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour
of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot
buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

=E2=80=98What a curious feeling!=E2=80=99 said Alice; =E2=80=98I must be sh=
utting up like a
telescope.=E2=80=99

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; =E2=80=98for it might end, you know,=
=E2=80=99 said
Alice to herself, =E2=80=98in my going out altogether, like a candle. I won=
der
what I should be like then?=E2=80=99 And she tried to fancy what the flame =
of a
candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.

=E2=80=98Come, there=E2=80=99s no use in crying like that!=E2=80=99 said Al=
ice to herself,
rather sharply; =E2=80=98I advise you to leave off this minute!=E2=80=99 Sh=
e generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
=E2=80=98But it=E2=80=99s no use now,=E2=80=99 thought poor Alice, =E2=80=
=98to pretend to be two people!
Why, there=E2=80=99s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable perso=
n!=E2=80=99

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
=E2=80=98EAT ME=E2=80=99 were beautifully marked in currants. =E2=80=98Well=
, I=E2=80=99ll eat it,=E2=80=99 said
Alice, =E2=80=98and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if=
 it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I=E2=80=99=
ll
get into the garden, and I don=E2=80=99t care which happens!=E2=80=99

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, =E2=80=98Which way? Wh=
ich
way?=E2=80=99, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it=
 was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on
in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *




CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears

=E2=80=98Curiouser and curiouser!=E2=80=99 cried Alice (she was so much sur=
prised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); =E2=80=98now I=
=E2=80=99m
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!=E2=80=
=99
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off). =E2=80=98Oh, my poor little feet, I w=
onder
who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I=E2=80=99m su=
re
_I_ shan=E2=80=99t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be
kind to them,=E2=80=99 thought Alice, =E2=80=98or perhaps they won=E2=80=99=
t walk the way I want
to go! Let me see: I=E2=80=99ll give them a new pair of boots every Christm=
as.=E2=80=99

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. =E2=80=98They =
must
go by the carrier,=E2=80=99 she thought; =E2=80=98and how funny it=E2=80=99=
ll seem, sending
presents to one=E2=80=99s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     ALICE=E2=80=99S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
       HEARTHRUG,
         NEAR THE FENDER,
           (WITH ALICE=E2=80=99S LOVE).

Oh dear, what nonsense I=E2=80=99m talking!=E2=80=99

Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

=E2=80=98You ought to be ashamed of yourself,=E2=80=99 said Alice, =E2=80=
=98a great girl like
you,=E2=80=99 (she might well say this), =E2=80=98to go on crying in this w=
ay! Stop this
moment, I tell you!=E2=80=99 But she went on all the same, shedding gallons=
 of
tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in
one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
hurry, muttering to himself as he came, =E2=80=98Oh! the Duchess, the Duche=
ss!
Oh! won=E2=80=99t she be savage if I=E2=80=99ve kept her waiting!=E2=80=99 =
Alice felt so
desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, =E2=80=98If you please, si=
r--=E2=80=99
The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,
and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: =E2=80=98Dear, dear!=
 How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I=E2=80=99ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a
little different. But if I=E2=80=99m not the same, the next question is, Wh=
o
in the world am I? Ah, THAT=E2=80=99S the great puzzle!=E2=80=99 And she be=
gan thinking
over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to
see if she could have been changed for any of them.

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m sure I=E2=80=99m not Ada,=E2=80=99 she said, =E2=80=98=
for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn=E2=80=99t go in ringlets at all; and I=E2=80=99m s=
ure I can=E2=80=99t
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, SHE=E2=80=99S she, and I=E2=80=99m I, and--oh dear, h=
ow puzzling
it all is! I=E2=80=99ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me
see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and
four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
However, the Multiplication Table doesn=E2=80=99t signify: let=E2=80=99s tr=
y Geography.
London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and
Rome--no, THAT=E2=80=99S all wrong, I=E2=80=99m certain! I must have been c=
hanged for
Mabel! I=E2=80=99ll try and say =E2=80=9CHow doth the little--=E2=80=9C=E2=
=80=99 and she crossed her
hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,
but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the
same as they used to do:--

     =E2=80=98How doth the little crocodile
      Improve his shining tail,
     And pour the waters of the Nile
      On every golden scale!

     =E2=80=98How cheerfully he seems to grin,
      How neatly spread his claws,
     And welcome little fishes in
      With gently smiling jaws!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m sure those are not the right words,=E2=80=99 said poor=
 Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, =E2=80=98I must be Mabel after all,=
 and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I=E2=80=99=
ve
made up my mind about it; if I=E2=80=99m Mabel, I=E2=80=99ll stay down here=
! It=E2=80=99ll be no
use their putting their heads down and saying =E2=80=9CCome up again, dear!=
=E2=80=9D I
shall only look up and say =E2=80=9CWho am I then? Tell me that first, and =
then,
if I like being that person, I=E2=80=99ll come up: if not, I=E2=80=99ll sta=
y down here
till I=E2=80=99m somebody else=E2=80=9D--but, oh dear!=E2=80=99 cried Alice=
, with a sudden burst
of tears, =E2=80=98I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY =
tired
of being all alone here!=E2=80=99

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the Rabbit=E2=80=99s little white kid gloves whi=
le
she was talking. =E2=80=98How CAN I have done that?=E2=80=99 she thought. =
=E2=80=98I must
be growing small again.=E2=80=99 She got up and went to the table to measur=
e
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found
out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped
it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

=E2=80=98That WAS a narrow escape!=E2=80=99 said Alice, a good deal frighte=
ned at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; =E2=80=98a=
nd
now for the garden!=E2=80=99 and she ran with all speed back to the little =
door:
but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was
lying on the glass table as before, =E2=80=98and things are worse than ever=
,=E2=80=99
thought the poor child, =E2=80=98for I never was so small as this before, n=
ever!
And I declare it=E2=80=99s too bad, that it is!=E2=80=99

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she
had somehow fallen into the sea, =E2=80=98and in that case I can go back by
railway,=E2=80=99 she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once =
in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon
made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
was nine feet high.

=E2=80=98I wish I hadn=E2=80=99t cried so much!=E2=80=99 said Alice, as she=
 swam about, trying
to find her way out. =E2=80=98I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!
However, everything is queer to-day.=E2=80=99

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

=E2=80=98Would it be of any use, now,=E2=80=99 thought Alice, =E2=80=98to s=
peak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there=E2=80=99s no harm in trying.=E2=80=
=99 So she
began: =E2=80=98O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very ti=
red
of swimming about here, O Mouse!=E2=80=99 (Alice thought this must be the r=
ight
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brother=E2=80=99s Latin Grammar, =E2=80=
=98A mouse--of
a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!=E2=80=99) The Mouse looked at her ra=
ther
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.

=E2=80=98Perhaps it doesn=E2=80=99t understand English,=E2=80=99 thought Al=
ice; =E2=80=98I daresay it=E2=80=99s
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.=E2=80=99 (For, with a=
ll
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: =E2=80=98Ou est ma chatte?=E2=
=80=99 which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
=E2=80=98Oh, I beg your pardon!=E2=80=99 cried Alice hastily, afraid that s=
he had hurt
the poor animal=E2=80=99s feelings. =E2=80=98I quite forgot you didn=E2=80=
=99t like cats.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Not like cats!=E2=80=99 cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate v=
oice. =E2=80=98Would
YOU like cats if you were me?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Well, perhaps not,=E2=80=99 said Alice in a soothing tone: =E2=80=
=98don=E2=80=99t be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you=E2=80=
=99d
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
thing,=E2=80=99 Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in=
 the
pool, =E2=80=98and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws=
 and
washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she=E2=80=
=99s
such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!=E2=80=99 cried
Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
felt certain it must be really offended. =E2=80=98We won=E2=80=99t talk abo=
ut her any
more if you=E2=80=99d rather not.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98We indeed!=E2=80=99 cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the=
 end of his
tail. =E2=80=98As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATE=
D
cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don=E2=80=99t let me hear the name again!=
=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I won=E2=80=99t indeed!=E2=80=99 said Alice, in a great hurry to c=
hange the subject of
conversation. =E2=80=98Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?=E2=80=99 The Mou=
se did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: =E2=80=98There is such a nice little dog =
near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it=E2=80=99ll fetch things w=
hen
you throw them, and it=E2=80=99ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all so=
rts
of things--I can=E2=80=99t remember half of them--and it belongs to a farme=
r,
you know, and he says it=E2=80=99s so useful, it=E2=80=99s worth a hundred =
pounds! He
says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!=E2=80=99 cried Alice in a sorrowfu=
l
tone, =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m afraid I=E2=80=99ve offended it again!=E2=80=99 =
For the Mouse was swimming
away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in
the pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, =E2=80=98Mouse dear! Do come back again, and=
 we
won=E2=80=99t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don=E2=80=99t like the=
m!=E2=80=99 When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, =E2=80=98Let us get to the shore, and then I=E2=80=99ll te=
ll you my
history, and you=E2=80=99ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.=E2=
=80=99

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,
a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale

They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, =E2=80=98I am older tha=
n
you, and must know better=E2=80=99; and this Alice would not allow without
knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its
age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, =E2=80=98Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I=E2=80=99LL s=
oon make you
dry enough!=E2=80=99 They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the M=
ouse
in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

=E2=80=98Ahem!=E2=80=99 said the Mouse with an important air, =E2=80=98are =
you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! =E2=80=9CWill=
iam
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria--=E2=80=9C=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Ugh!=E2=80=99 said the Lory, with a shiver.

=E2=80=98I beg your pardon!=E2=80=99 said the Mouse, frowning, but very pol=
itely: =E2=80=98Did
you speak?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Not I!=E2=80=99 said the Lory hastily.

=E2=80=98I thought you did,=E2=80=99 said the Mouse. =E2=80=98--I proceed. =
=E2=80=9CEdwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,
the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--=E2=80=9C=E2=80=
=99

=E2=80=98Found WHAT?=E2=80=99 said the Duck.

=E2=80=98Found IT,=E2=80=99 the Mouse replied rather crossly: =E2=80=98of c=
ourse you know what
=E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=9D means.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I know what =E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=9D means well enough, when I find a =
thing,=E2=80=99 said the
Duck: =E2=80=98it=E2=80=99s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, wh=
at did the
archbishop find?=E2=80=99

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, =E2=80=98=E2=
=80=9C--found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
crown. William=E2=80=99s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence o=
f his
Normans--=E2=80=9D How are you getting on now, my dear?=E2=80=99 it continu=
ed, turning
to Alice as it spoke.

=E2=80=98As wet as ever,=E2=80=99 said Alice in a melancholy tone: =E2=80=
=98it doesn=E2=80=99t seem to
dry me at all.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98In that case,=E2=80=99 said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet,=
 =E2=80=98I move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Speak English!=E2=80=99 said the Eaglet. =E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t =
know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what=E2=80=99s more, I don=E2=80=99t believe you do =
either!=E2=80=99 And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

=E2=80=98What I was going to say,=E2=80=99 said the Dodo in an offended ton=
e, =E2=80=98was, that
the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98What IS a Caucus-race?=E2=80=99 said Alice; not that she wanted mu=
ch to know,
but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,
and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

=E2=80=98Why,=E2=80=99 said the Dodo, =E2=80=98the best way to explain it i=
s to do it.=E2=80=99 (And, as
you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell
you how the Dodo managed it.)

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, [=E2=80=98the exact
shape doesn=E2=80=99t matter,=E2=80=99 it said,) and then all the party wer=
e placed
along the course, here and there. There was no =E2=80=98One, two, three, an=
d
away,=E2=80=99 but they began running when they liked, and left off when th=
ey
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
the Dodo suddenly called out =E2=80=98The race is over!=E2=80=99 and they a=
ll crowded
round it, panting, and asking, =E2=80=98But who has won?=E2=80=99

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures
of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,
=E2=80=98EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98But who is to give the prizes?=E2=80=99 quite a chorus of voices a=
sked.

=E2=80=98Why, SHE, of course,=E2=80=99 said the Dodo, pointing to Alice wit=
h one finger;
and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
way, =E2=80=98Prizes! Prizes!=E2=80=99

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one
a-piece all round.

=E2=80=98But she must have a prize herself, you know,=E2=80=99 said the Mou=
se.

=E2=80=98Of course,=E2=80=99 the Dodo replied very gravely. =E2=80=98What e=
lse have you got in
your pocket?=E2=80=99 he went on, turning to Alice.

=E2=80=98Only a thimble,=E2=80=99 said Alice sadly.

=E2=80=98Hand it over here,=E2=80=99 said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying =E2=80=98We beg your acceptance of this elega=
nt
thimble=E2=80=99; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all che=
ered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

=E2=80=98You promised to tell me your history, you know,=E2=80=99 said Alic=
e, =E2=80=98and why
it is you hate--C and D,=E2=80=99 she added in a whisper, half afraid that =
it
would be offended again.

=E2=80=98Mine is a long and a sad tale!=E2=80=99 said the Mouse, turning to=
 Alice, and
sighing.

=E2=80=98It IS a long tail, certainly,=E2=80=99 said Alice, looking down wi=
th wonder at
the Mouse=E2=80=99s tail; =E2=80=98but why do you call it sad?=E2=80=99 And=
 she kept on puzzling
about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
something like this:--

         =E2=80=98Fury said to a
         mouse, That he
        met in the
       house,
     =E2=80=9CLet us
      both go to
       law: I will
        prosecute
         YOU.--Come,
           I=E2=80=99ll take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I=E2=80=99ve
    nothing
    to do.=E2=80=9D
      Said the
      mouse to the
       cur, =E2=80=9CSuch
        a trial,
         dear Sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath.=E2=80=9D
        =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll be
        judge, I=E2=80=99ll
         be jury,=E2=80=9D
             Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99


=E2=80=98You are not attending!=E2=80=99 said the Mouse to Alice severely. =
=E2=80=98What are you
thinking of?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I beg your pardon,=E2=80=99 said Alice very humbly: =E2=80=98you h=
ad got to the fifth
bend, I think?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I had NOT!=E2=80=99 cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

=E2=80=98A knot!=E2=80=99 said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, =
and looking
anxiously about her. =E2=80=98Oh, do let me help to undo it!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I shall do nothing of the sort,=E2=80=99 said the Mouse, getting u=
p and walking
away. =E2=80=98You insult me by talking such nonsense!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I didn=E2=80=99t mean it!=E2=80=99 pleaded poor Alice. =E2=80=98Bu=
t you=E2=80=99re so easily offended,
you know!=E2=80=99

The Mouse only growled in reply.

=E2=80=98Please come back and finish your story!=E2=80=99 Alice called afte=
r it; and the
others all joined in chorus, =E2=80=98Yes, please do!=E2=80=99 but the Mous=
e only shook
its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

=E2=80=98What a pity it wouldn=E2=80=99t stay!=E2=80=99 sighed the Lory, as=
 soon as it was quite
out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
daughter =E2=80=98Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
YOUR temper!=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98Hold your tongue, Ma!=E2=80=99 said the youn=
g Crab, a little
snappishly. =E2=80=98You=E2=80=99re enough to try the patience of an oyster=
!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!=E2=80=99 said Alice alou=
d, addressing
nobody in particular. =E2=80=98She=E2=80=99d soon fetch it back!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?=E2=80=99=
 said the
Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
=E2=80=98Dinah=E2=80=99s our cat. And she=E2=80=99s such a capital one for =
catching mice you
can=E2=80=99t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
she=E2=80=99ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!=E2=80=99

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, =E2=80=98I really must be getting home; the night-air
doesn=E2=80=99t suit my throat!=E2=80=99 and a Canary called out in a tremb=
ling voice to
its children, =E2=80=98Come away, my dears! It=E2=80=99s high time you were=
 all in bed!=E2=80=99
On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

=E2=80=98I wish I hadn=E2=80=99t mentioned Dinah!=E2=80=99 she said to hers=
elf in a melancholy
tone. =E2=80=98Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I=E2=80=99m sure sh=
e=E2=80=99s the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more!=E2=80=99 And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt ver=
y
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard
a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
back to finish his story.




CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill

It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself =E2=80=98The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! =
Oh
my fur and whiskers! She=E2=80=99ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?=E2=80=99 Alice guessed in=
 a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, =E2=80=98Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you do=
ing
out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!
Quick, now!=E2=80=99 And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at o=
nce
in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it
had made.

=E2=80=98He took me for his housemaid,=E2=80=99 she said to herself as she =
ran. =E2=80=98How
surprised he=E2=80=99ll be when he finds out who I am! But I=E2=80=99d bett=
er take him
his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.=E2=80=99 As she said this,=
 she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name =E2=80=98W. RABBIT=E2=80=99 engraved upon it. She went =
in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.

=E2=80=98How queer it seems,=E2=80=99 Alice said to herself, =E2=80=98to be=
 going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinah=E2=80=99ll be sending me on messages next!=E2=80=
=99 And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: =E2=80=98=E2=80=9CMiss =
Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CComing in a m=
inute,
nurse! But I=E2=80=99ve got to see that the mouse doesn=E2=80=99t get out.=
=E2=80=9D Only I don=E2=80=99t
think,=E2=80=99 Alice went on, =E2=80=98that they=E2=80=99d let Dinah stop =
in the house if it
began ordering people about like that!=E2=80=99

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time
with the words =E2=80=98DRINK ME,=E2=80=99 but nevertheless she uncorked it=
 and put it
to her lips. =E2=80=98I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,=E2=80=
=99 she said
to herself, =E2=80=98whenever I eat or drink anything; so I=E2=80=99ll just=
 see what
this bottle does. I do hope it=E2=80=99ll make me grow large again, for rea=
lly
I=E2=80=99m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!=E2=80=99

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s quite enough--I =
hope I shan=E2=80=99t
grow any more--As it is, I can=E2=80=99t get out at the door--I do wish I h=
adn=E2=80=99t
drunk quite so much!=E2=80=99

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself =E2=80=98No=
w I
can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?=E2=80=99

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

=E2=80=98It was much pleasanter at home,=E2=80=99 thought poor Alice, =E2=
=80=98when one wasn=E2=80=99t
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadn=E2=80=99t gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet=
--and
yet--it=E2=80=99s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder =
what
CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that
kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I
grow up, I=E2=80=99ll write one--but I=E2=80=99m grown up now,=E2=80=99 she=
 added in a sorrowful
tone; =E2=80=98at least there=E2=80=99s no room to grow up any more HERE.=
=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98But then,=E2=80=99 thought Alice, =E2=80=98shall I NEVER get any o=
lder than I am
now? That=E2=80=99ll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but
then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn=E2=80=99t like THAT!=
=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Oh, you foolish Alice!=E2=80=99 she answered herself. =E2=80=98How=
 can you learn
lessons in here? Why, there=E2=80=99s hardly room for YOU, and no room at a=
ll
for any lesson-books!=E2=80=99

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making
quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard
a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

=E2=80=98Mary Ann! Mary Ann!=E2=80=99 said the voice. =E2=80=98Fetch me my =
gloves this moment!=E2=80=99
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and Alice=E2=80=99s elbow was pressed hard against=
 it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself =E2=80=98Then I=
=E2=80=99ll
go round and get in at the window.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98THAT you won=E2=80=99t=E2=80=99 thought Alice, and, after waiting =
till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit=E2=80=99s--=E2=80=98Pat! Pat! Where ar=
e you?=E2=80=99 And
then a voice she had never heard before, =E2=80=98Sure then I=E2=80=99m her=
e! Digging
for apples, yer honour!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Digging for apples, indeed!=E2=80=99 said the Rabbit angrily. =E2=
=80=98Here! Come and
help me out of THIS!=E2=80=99 (Sounds of more broken glass.)

=E2=80=98Now tell me, Pat, what=E2=80=99s that in the window?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Sure, it=E2=80=99s an arm, yer honour!=E2=80=99 (He pronounced it =
=E2=80=98arrum.=E2=80=99)

=E2=80=98An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the w=
hole
window!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Sure, it does, yer honour: but it=E2=80=99s an arm for all that.=
=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Well, it=E2=80=99s got no business there, at any rate: go and take=
 it away!=E2=80=99

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, =E2=80=98Sure, I don=E2=80=99t like it, yer honour, =
at all, at
all!=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98Do as I tell you, you coward!=E2=80=99 and at last s=
he spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. =E2=80=98What a number=
 of
cucumber-frames there must be!=E2=80=99 thought Alice. =E2=80=98I wonder wh=
at they=E2=80=99ll do
next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I=E2=80=
=99m
sure I don=E2=80=99t want to stay in here any longer!=E2=80=99

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices
all talking together: she made out the words: =E2=80=98Where=E2=80=99s the =
other
ladder?--Why, I hadn=E2=80=99t to bring but one; Bill=E2=80=99s got the oth=
er--Bill!
fetch it here, lad!--Here, put =E2=80=98em up at this corner--No, tie =E2=
=80=98em
together first--they don=E2=80=99t reach half high enough yet--Oh! they=E2=
=80=99ll
do well enough; don=E2=80=99t be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this
rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it=E2=80=99s coming
down! Heads below!=E2=80=99 (a loud crash)--=E2=80=98Now, who did that?--It=
 was Bill, I
fancy--Who=E2=80=99s to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan=E2=80=99t! YOU do=
 it!--That I
won=E2=80=99t, then!--Bill=E2=80=99s to go down--Here, Bill! the master say=
s you=E2=80=99re to
go down the chimney!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Oh! So Bill=E2=80=99s got to come down the chimney, has he?=E2=80=
=99 said Alice to
herself. =E2=80=98Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn=E2=
=80=99t be in
Bill=E2=80=99s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure;=
 but
I THINK I can kick a little!=E2=80=99

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited
till she heard a little animal (she couldn=E2=80=99t guess of what sort it =
was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself =E2=80=98This is Bill,=E2=80=99 she gave one sharp kick, =
and waited to
see what would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of =E2=80=98There goes Bill!=
=E2=80=99
then the Rabbit=E2=80=99s voice along--=E2=80=98Catch him, you by the hedge=
!=E2=80=99 then
silence, and then another confusion of voices--=E2=80=98Hold up his head--B=
randy
now--Don=E2=80=99t choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you?=
 Tell
us all about it!=E2=80=99

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, [=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s Bill,=
=E2=80=99 thought
Alice,) =E2=80=98Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I=E2=80=99m better=
 now--but I=E2=80=99m
a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98So you did, old fellow!=E2=80=99 said the others.

=E2=80=98We must burn the house down!=E2=80=99 said the Rabbit=E2=80=99s vo=
ice; and Alice called
out as loud as she could, =E2=80=98If you do. I=E2=80=99ll set Dinah at you=
!=E2=80=99

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, =E2=80=98=
I
wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they=E2=80=99d take t=
he
roof off.=E2=80=99 After a minute or two, they began moving about again, an=
d
Alice heard the Rabbit say, =E2=80=98A barrowful will do, to begin with.=E2=
=80=99

=E2=80=98A barrowful of WHAT?=E2=80=99 thought Alice; but she had not long =
to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ll put a s=
top to this,=E2=80=99
she said to herself, and shouted out, =E2=80=98You=E2=80=99d better not do =
that again!=E2=80=99
which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. =E2=80=98If I eat one of these cakes,=E2=80=99 she thought, =E2=80=98=
it=E2=80=99s sure to make
SOME change in my size; and as it can=E2=80=99t possibly make me larger, it=
 must
make me smaller, I suppose.=E2=80=99

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through
the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was
in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

=E2=80=98The first thing I=E2=80=99ve got to do,=E2=80=99 said Alice to her=
self, as she wandered
about in the wood, =E2=80=98is to grow to my right size again; and the seco=
nd
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be
the best plan.=E2=80=99

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. =E2=80=98Poor little th=
ing!=E2=80=99
said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but
she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be
hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
till the puppy=E2=80=99s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

=E2=80=98And yet what a dear little puppy it was!=E2=80=99 said Alice, as s=
he leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: =E2=80=98I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I=
=E2=80=99d
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I=E2=80=99d nearly forgotten th=
at
I=E2=80=99ve got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?=E2=80=99

The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long
hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.




CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar

The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
her in a languid, sleepy voice.

=E2=80=98Who are YOU?=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, =E2=80=98I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I k=
now
who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98What do you mean by that?=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar sternly. =
=E2=80=98Explain
yourself!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I can=E2=80=99t explain MYSELF, I=E2=80=99m afraid, sir=E2=80=99 s=
aid Alice, =E2=80=98because I=E2=80=99m not
myself, you see.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t see,=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar.

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m afraid I can=E2=80=99t put it more clearly,=E2=80=99 A=
lice replied very politely,
=E2=80=98for I can=E2=80=99t understand it myself to begin with; and being =
so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It isn=E2=80=99t,=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar.

=E2=80=98Well, perhaps you haven=E2=80=99t found it so yet,=E2=80=99 said A=
lice; =E2=80=98but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you=E2=80=99ll feel it a little
queer, won=E2=80=99t you?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Not a bit,=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar.

=E2=80=98Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,=E2=80=99 said Alice;=
 =E2=80=98all I know
is, it would feel very queer to ME.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98You!=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar contemptuously. =E2=80=98Who ar=
e YOU?=E2=80=99

Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar=E2=80=99s making such VERY
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, =E2=80=98I t=
hink,
you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Why?=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.

=E2=80=98Come back!=E2=80=99 the Caterpillar called after her. =E2=80=98I=
=E2=80=99ve something important
to say!=E2=80=99

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

=E2=80=98Keep your temper,=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar.

=E2=80=98Is that all?=E2=80=99 said Alice, swallowing down her anger as wel=
l as she
could.

=E2=80=98No,=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some
minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, =E2=80=98So you thi=
nk
you=E2=80=99re changed, do you?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m afraid I am, sir,=E2=80=99 said Alice; =E2=80=98I can=
=E2=80=99t remember things as I
used--and I don=E2=80=99t keep the same size for ten minutes together!=E2=
=80=99

=E2=80=98Can=E2=80=99t remember WHAT things?=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar.

=E2=80=98Well, I=E2=80=99ve tried to say =E2=80=9CHOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY =
BEE,=E2=80=9D but it all came
different!=E2=80=99 Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

=E2=80=98Repeat, =E2=80=9CYOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99 sa=
id the Caterpillar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:--

   =E2=80=98You are old, Father William,=E2=80=99 the young man said,
    =E2=80=98And your hair has become very white;
   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?=E2=80=99

   =E2=80=98In my youth,=E2=80=99 Father William replied to his son,
    =E2=80=98I feared it might injure the brain;
   But, now that I=E2=80=99m perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.=E2=80=99

   =E2=80=98You are old,=E2=80=99 said the youth, =E2=80=98as I mentioned b=
efore,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
    Pray, what is the reason of that?=E2=80=99

   =E2=80=98In my youth,=E2=80=99 said the sage, as he shook his grey locks=
,
    =E2=80=98I kept all my limbs very supple
   By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
    Allow me to sell you a couple?=E2=80=99

   =E2=80=98You are old,=E2=80=99 said the youth, =E2=80=98and your jaws ar=
e too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
    Pray how did you manage to do it?=E2=80=99

   =E2=80=98In my youth,=E2=80=99 said his father, =E2=80=98I took to the l=
aw,
    And argued each case with my wife;
   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.=E2=80=99

   =E2=80=98You are old,=E2=80=99 said the youth, =E2=80=98one would hardly=
 suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
    What made you so awfully clever?=E2=80=99

   =E2=80=98I have answered three questions, and that is enough,=E2=80=99
    Said his father; =E2=80=98don=E2=80=99t give yourself airs!
   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I=E2=80=99ll kick you down stairs!=E2=80=99


=E2=80=98That is not said right,=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar.

=E2=80=98Not QUITE right, I=E2=80=99m afraid,=E2=80=99 said Alice, timidly;=
 =E2=80=98some of the words
have got altered.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It is wrong from beginning to end,=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar d=
ecidedly, and
there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

=E2=80=98What size do you want to be?=E2=80=99 it asked.

=E2=80=98Oh, I=E2=80=99m not particular as to size,=E2=80=99 Alice hastily =
replied; =E2=80=98only one
doesn=E2=80=99t like changing so often, you know.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I DON=E2=80=99T know,=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

=E2=80=98Are you content now?=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar.

=E2=80=98Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn=E2=
=80=99t mind,=E2=80=99
said Alice: =E2=80=98three inches is such a wretched height to be.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It is a very good height indeed!=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar ang=
rily, rearing
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

=E2=80=98But I=E2=80=99m not used to it!=E2=80=99 pleaded poor Alice in a p=
iteous tone. And
she thought of herself, =E2=80=98I wish the creatures wouldn=E2=80=99t be s=
o easily
offended!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98You=E2=80=99ll get used to it in time,=E2=80=99 said the Caterpill=
ar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In
a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
=E2=80=98One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make y=
ou
grow shorter.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?=E2=80=99 thought Alice t=
o herself.

=E2=80=98Of the mushroom,=E2=80=99 said the Caterpillar, just as if she had=
 asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she
stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
of the edge with each hand.

=E2=80=98And now which is which?=E2=80=99 she said to herself, and nibbled =
a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent
blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.


  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

=E2=80=98Come, my head=E2=80=99s free at last!=E2=80=99 said Alice in a ton=
e of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

=E2=80=98What CAN all that green stuff be?=E2=80=99 said Alice. =E2=80=98An=
d where HAVE my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can=E2=80=99t see you?=
=E2=80=99
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she
tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her
neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had
just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going
to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops
of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made
her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and
was beating her violently with its wings.

=E2=80=98Serpent!=E2=80=99 screamed the Pigeon.

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m NOT a serpent!=E2=80=99 said Alice indignantly. =E2=80=
=98Let me alone!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Serpent, I say again!=E2=80=99 repeated the Pigeon, but in a more =
subdued tone,
and added with a kind of sob, =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ve tried every way, and no=
thing seems
to suit them!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I haven=E2=80=99t the least idea what you=E2=80=99re talking about=
,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ve tried the roots of trees, and I=E2=80=99ve tried bank=
s, and I=E2=80=99ve tried
hedges,=E2=80=99 the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; =E2=80=98but=
 those
serpents! There=E2=80=99s no pleasing them!=E2=80=99

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

=E2=80=98As if it wasn=E2=80=99t trouble enough hatching the eggs,=E2=80=99=
 said the Pigeon;
=E2=80=98but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
haven=E2=80=99t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m very sorry you=E2=80=99ve been annoyed,=E2=80=99 said =
Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

=E2=80=98And just as I=E2=80=99d taken the highest tree in the wood,=E2=80=
=99 continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, =E2=80=98and just as I was thinking =
I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from
the sky! Ugh, Serpent!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98But I=E2=80=99m NOT a serpent, I tell you!=E2=80=99 said Alice. =
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m a--I=E2=80=99m a--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Well! WHAT are you?=E2=80=99 said the Pigeon. =E2=80=98I can see y=
ou=E2=80=99re trying to
invent something!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I--I=E2=80=99m a little girl,=E2=80=99 said Alice, rather doubtful=
ly, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.

=E2=80=98A likely story indeed!=E2=80=99 said the Pigeon in a tone of the d=
eepest
contempt. =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ve seen a good many little girls in my time, b=
ut never ONE
with such a neck as that! No, no! You=E2=80=99re a serpent; and there=E2=80=
=99s no use
denying it. I suppose you=E2=80=99ll be telling me next that you never tast=
ed an
egg!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,=E2=80=99 said Alice, who was a very=
 truthful
child; =E2=80=98but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t believe it,=E2=80=99 said the Pigeon; =E2=80=98but=
 if they do, why then they=E2=80=99re
a kind of serpent, that=E2=80=99s all I can say.=E2=80=99

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, =E2=80=98Yo=
u=E2=80=99re
looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me
whether you=E2=80=99re a little girl or a serpent?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It matters a good deal to ME,=E2=80=99 said Alice hastily; =E2=80=
=98but I=E2=80=99m not looking
for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn=E2=80=99t want YOURS: I do=
n=E2=80=99t
like them raw.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Well, be off, then!=E2=80=99 said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as i=
t settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as
she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she
remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. =E2=80=98Come, there=E2=80=99s half=
 my plan done
now! How puzzling all these changes are! I=E2=80=99m never sure what I=E2=
=80=99m going
to be, from one minute to another! However, I=E2=80=99ve got back to my rig=
ht
size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that
to be done, I wonder?=E2=80=99 As she said this, she came suddenly upon an =
open
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. =E2=80=98Whoever liv=
es
there,=E2=80=99 thought Alice, =E2=80=98it=E2=80=99ll never do to come upon=
 them THIS size: why,
I should frighten them out of their wits!=E2=80=99 So she began nibbling at=
 the
righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she
had brought herself down to nine inches high.




CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper

For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened
by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all
over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,
and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, =E2=80=98For the Duchess. An invitation from the =
Queen
to play croquet.=E2=80=99 The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn ton=
e,
only changing the order of the words a little, =E2=80=98From the Queen. An
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.=E2=80=99

Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the
wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

=E2=80=98There=E2=80=99s no sort of use in knocking,=E2=80=99 said the Foot=
man, =E2=80=98and that for
two reasons. First, because I=E2=80=99m on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because they=E2=80=99re making such a noise inside, no one c=
ould
possibly hear you.=E2=80=99 And certainly there was a most extraordinary no=
ise
going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.

=E2=80=98Please, then,=E2=80=99 said Alice, =E2=80=98how am I to get in?=E2=
=80=99

=E2=80=98There might be some sense in your knocking,=E2=80=99 the Footman w=
ent on
without attending to her, =E2=80=98if we had the door between us. For insta=
nce,
if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.=E2=
=80=99
He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this
Alice thought decidedly uncivil. =E2=80=98But perhaps he can=E2=80=99t help=
 it,=E2=80=99 she
said to herself; =E2=80=98his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his hea=
d.
But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?=E2=80=99 sh=
e
repeated, aloud.

=E2=80=98I shall sit here,=E2=80=99 the Footman remarked, =E2=80=98till tom=
orrow--=E2=80=99

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footman=E2=80=99s head: it just grazed his no=
se,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

=E2=80=98--or next day, maybe,=E2=80=99 the Footman continued in the same t=
one, exactly
as if nothing had happened.

=E2=80=98How am I to get in?=E2=80=99 asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

=E2=80=98ARE you to get in at all?=E2=80=99 said the Footman. =E2=80=98That=
=E2=80=99s the first
question, you know.=E2=80=99

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. =E2=80=98It=E2=80=
=99s really
dreadful,=E2=80=99 she muttered to herself, =E2=80=98the way all the creatu=
res argue.
It=E2=80=99s enough to drive one crazy!=E2=80=99

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. =E2=80=98I shall sit here,=E2=80=99 he said, =E2=
=80=98on and off, for
days and days.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98But what am I to do?=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Anything you like,=E2=80=99 said the Footman, and began whistling.

=E2=80=98Oh, there=E2=80=99s no use in talking to him,=E2=80=99 said Alice =
desperately: =E2=80=98he=E2=80=99s
perfectly idiotic!=E2=80=99 And she opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in
the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

=E2=80=98There=E2=80=99s certainly too much pepper in that soup!=E2=80=99 A=
lice said to herself,
as well as she could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess
sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment=E2=80=99s pause. The only things in the kitche=
n
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on
the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

=E2=80=98Please would you tell me,=E2=80=99 said Alice, a little timidly, f=
or she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, =E2=80=
=98why
your cat grins like that?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s a Cheshire cat,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess, =E2=80=98a=
nd that=E2=80=99s why. Pig!=E2=80=99

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--

=E2=80=98I didn=E2=80=99t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, =
I didn=E2=80=99t know
that cats COULD grin.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98They all can,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess; =E2=80=98and most of =E2=
=80=98em do.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t know of any that do,=E2=80=99 Alice said very poli=
tely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

=E2=80=98You don=E2=80=99t know much,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess; =E2=80=98a=
nd that=E2=80=99s a fact.=E2=80=99

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

=E2=80=98Oh, PLEASE mind what you=E2=80=99re doing!=E2=80=99 cried Alice, j=
umping up and down in
an agony of terror. =E2=80=98Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose=E2=80=99; as =
an unusually
large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.

=E2=80=98If everybody minded their own business,=E2=80=99 the Duchess said =
in a hoarse
growl, =E2=80=98the world would go round a deal faster than it does.=E2=80=
=99

=E2=80=98Which would NOT be an advantage,=E2=80=99 said Alice, who felt ver=
y glad to get
an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. =E2=80=98Just thin=
k of
what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Talking of axes,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess, =E2=80=98chop off her =
head!=E2=80=99

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: =E2=80=98Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or=
 is
it twelve? I--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Oh, don=E2=80=99t bother ME,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess; =E2=80=98I=
 never could abide figures!=E2=80=99
And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of
lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of
every line:

   =E2=80=98Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
   He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.=E2=80=99

         CHORUS.

 (In which the cook and the baby joined):--

       =E2=80=98Wow! wow! wow!=E2=80=99

While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:--

   =E2=80=98I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
   For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!=E2=80=99

         CHORUS.

       =E2=80=98Wow! wow! wow!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!=E2=80=99 the Duchess sa=
id to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. =E2=80=98I must go and get ready to =
play
croquet with the Queen,=E2=80=99 and she hurried out of the room. The cook =
threw
a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, =E2=80=
=98just
like a star-fish,=E2=80=99 thought Alice. The poor little thing was snortin=
g
like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute
or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried
it out into the open air. =E2=80=98IF I don=E2=80=99t take this child away =
with me,=E2=80=99
thought Alice, =E2=80=98they=E2=80=99re sure to kill it in a day or two: wo=
uldn=E2=80=99t it be
murder to leave it behind?=E2=80=99 She said the last words out loud, and t=
he
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
=E2=80=98Don=E2=80=99t grunt,=E2=80=99 said Alice; =E2=80=98that=E2=80=99s =
not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself.=E2=80=99

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to
see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its
eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
like the look of the thing at all. =E2=80=98But perhaps it was only sobbing=
,=E2=80=99
she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any
tears.

No, there were no tears. =E2=80=98If you=E2=80=99re going to turn into a pi=
g, my dear,=E2=80=99
said Alice, seriously, =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ll have nothing more to do with y=
ou. Mind
now!=E2=80=99 The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was imposs=
ible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, =E2=80=98Now, what am I to do=
 with
this creature when I get it home?=E2=80=99 when it grunted again, so violen=
tly,
that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could
be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she
felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
it trot away quietly into the wood. =E2=80=98If it had grown up,=E2=80=99 s=
he said
to herself, =E2=80=98it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it mak=
es
rather a handsome pig, I think.=E2=80=99 And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, =E2=80=98if one only knew the right way to change them--=E2=80=
=99 when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
tree a few yards off.

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

=E2=80=98Cheshire Puss,=E2=80=99 she began, rather timidly, as she did not =
at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
=E2=80=98Come, it=E2=80=99s pleased so far,=E2=80=99 thought Alice, and she=
 went on. =E2=80=98Would you
tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,=E2=80=99 sai=
d the Cat.

=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t much care where--=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Then it doesn=E2=80=99t matter which way you go,=E2=80=99 said the=
 Cat.

=E2=80=98--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,=E2=80=99 Alice added as an explanati=
on.

=E2=80=98Oh, you=E2=80=99re sure to do that,=E2=80=99 said the Cat, =E2=80=
=98if you only walk long
enough.=E2=80=99

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.
=E2=80=98What sort of people live about here?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98In THAT direction,=E2=80=99 the Cat said, waving its right paw rou=
nd, =E2=80=98lives
a Hatter: and in THAT direction,=E2=80=99 waving the other paw, =E2=80=98li=
ves a March
Hare. Visit either you like: they=E2=80=99re both mad.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98But I don=E2=80=99t want to go among mad people,=E2=80=99 Alice re=
marked.

=E2=80=98Oh, you can=E2=80=99t help that,=E2=80=99 said the Cat: =E2=80=98w=
e=E2=80=99re all mad here. I=E2=80=99m mad.
You=E2=80=99re mad.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98How do you know I=E2=80=99m mad?=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98You must be,=E2=80=99 said the Cat, =E2=80=98or you wouldn=E2=80=
=99t have come here.=E2=80=99

Alice didn=E2=80=99t think that proved it at all; however, she went on =E2=
=80=98And how
do you know that you=E2=80=99re mad?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98To begin with,=E2=80=99 said the Cat, =E2=80=98a dog=E2=80=99s not=
 mad. You grant that?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I suppose so,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Well, then,=E2=80=99 the Cat went on, =E2=80=98you see, a dog grow=
ls when it=E2=80=99s angry,
and wags its tail when it=E2=80=99s pleased. Now I growl when I=E2=80=99m p=
leased, and
wag my tail when I=E2=80=99m angry. Therefore I=E2=80=99m mad.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I call it purring, not growling,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Call it what you like,=E2=80=99 said the Cat. =E2=80=98Do you play=
 croquet with the
Queen to-day?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I should like it very much,=E2=80=99 said Alice, =E2=80=98but I ha=
ven=E2=80=99t been invited
yet.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98You=E2=80=99ll see me there,=E2=80=99 said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

=E2=80=98By-the-bye, what became of the baby?=E2=80=99 said the Cat. =E2=80=
=98I=E2=80=99d nearly
forgotten to ask.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It turned into a pig,=E2=80=99 Alice quietly said, just as if it h=
ad come back
in a natural way.

=E2=80=98I thought it would,=E2=80=99 said the Cat, and vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ve seen hatters b=
efore,=E2=80=99 she
said to herself; =E2=80=98the March Hare will be much the most interesting,=
 and
perhaps as this is May it won=E2=80=99t be raving mad--at least not so mad =
as
it was in March.=E2=80=99 As she said this, she looked up, and there was th=
e Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

=E2=80=98Did you say pig, or fig?=E2=80=99 said the Cat.

=E2=80=98I said pig,=E2=80=99 replied Alice; =E2=80=98and I wish you wouldn=
=E2=80=99t keep appearing and
vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98All right,=E2=80=99 said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite =
slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

=E2=80=98Well! I=E2=80=99ve often seen a cat without a grin,=E2=80=99 thoug=
ht Alice; =E2=80=98but a grin
without a cat! It=E2=80=99s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!=
=E2=80=99

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house
of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to
about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,
saying to herself =E2=80=98Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I alm=
ost
wish I=E2=80=99d gone to see the Hatter instead!=E2=80=99




CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party

There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. =E2=80=98Ve=
ry
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,=E2=80=99 thought Alice; =E2=80=98only, as i=
t=E2=80=99s asleep, I
suppose it doesn=E2=80=99t mind.=E2=80=99

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: =E2=80=98No room! No room!=E2=80=99 they cried out when t=
hey saw Alice
coming. =E2=80=98There=E2=80=99s PLENTY of room!=E2=80=99 said Alice indign=
antly, and she sat
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

=E2=80=98Have some wine,=E2=80=99 the March Hare said in an encouraging ton=
e.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t see any wine,=E2=80=99 she remarked.

=E2=80=98There isn=E2=80=99t any,=E2=80=99 said the March Hare.

=E2=80=98Then it wasn=E2=80=99t very civil of you to offer it,=E2=80=99 sai=
d Alice angrily.

=E2=80=98It wasn=E2=80=99t very civil of you to sit down without being invi=
ted,=E2=80=99 said
the March Hare.

=E2=80=98I didn=E2=80=99t know it was YOUR table,=E2=80=99 said Alice; =E2=
=80=98it=E2=80=99s laid for a great
many more than three.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Your hair wants cutting,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter. He had been loo=
king at Alice
for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.

=E2=80=98You should learn not to make personal remarks,=E2=80=99 Alice said=
 with some
severity; =E2=80=98it=E2=80=99s very rude.=E2=80=99

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID
was, =E2=80=98Why is a raven like a writing-desk?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Come, we shall have some fun now!=E2=80=99 thought Alice. =E2=80=
=98I=E2=80=99m glad they=E2=80=99ve
begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,=E2=80=99 she added aloud=
.

=E2=80=98Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?=E2=
=80=99 said the
March Hare.

=E2=80=98Exactly so,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Then you should say what you mean,=E2=80=99 the March Hare went on=
.

=E2=80=98I do,=E2=80=99 Alice hastily replied; =E2=80=98at least--at least =
I mean what I
say--that=E2=80=99s the same thing, you know.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Not the same thing a bit!=E2=80=99 said the Hatter. =E2=80=98You m=
ight just as well say
that =E2=80=9CI see what I eat=E2=80=9D is the same thing as =E2=80=9CI eat=
 what I see=E2=80=9D!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98You might just as well say,=E2=80=99 added the March Hare, =E2=80=
=98that =E2=80=9CI like what I
get=E2=80=9D is the same thing as =E2=80=9CI get what I like=E2=80=9D!=E2=
=80=99

=E2=80=98You might just as well say,=E2=80=99 added the Dormouse, who seeme=
d to be
talking in his sleep, =E2=80=98that =E2=80=9CI breathe when I sleep=E2=80=
=9D is the same thing
as =E2=80=9CI sleep when I breathe=E2=80=9D!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It IS the same thing with you,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter, and here =
the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
which wasn=E2=80=99t much.

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. =E2=80=98What day of the mon=
th
is it?=E2=80=99 he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of hi=
s
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said =E2=80=98The fourth.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Two days wrong!=E2=80=99 sighed the Hatter. =E2=80=98I told you bu=
tter wouldn=E2=80=99t suit
the works!=E2=80=99 he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

=E2=80=98It was the BEST butter,=E2=80=99 the March Hare meekly replied.

=E2=80=98Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,=E2=80=99 the Hatter=
 grumbled:
=E2=80=98you shouldn=E2=80=99t have put it in with the bread-knife.=E2=80=
=99

The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, =E2=80=98It was the BEST butte=
r,
you know.=E2=80=99

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. =E2=80=98What=
 a
funny watch!=E2=80=99 she remarked. =E2=80=98It tells the day of the month,=
 and doesn=E2=80=99t
tell what o=E2=80=99clock it is!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Why should it?=E2=80=99 muttered the Hatter. =E2=80=98Does YOUR wa=
tch tell you what
year it is?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Of course not,=E2=80=99 Alice replied very readily: =E2=80=98but t=
hat=E2=80=99s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Which is just the case with MINE,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter=E2=80=99s remark seemed to have n=
o
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. =E2=80=98I don=E2=
=80=99t quite
understand you,=E2=80=99 she said, as politely as she could.

=E2=80=98The Dormouse is asleep again,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter, and he pou=
red a little
hot tea upon its nose.

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, =E2=80=98Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself=
.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Have you guessed the riddle yet?=E2=80=99 the Hatter said, turning=
 to Alice
again.

=E2=80=98No, I give it up,=E2=80=99 Alice replied: =E2=80=98what=E2=80=99s =
the answer?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I haven=E2=80=99t the slightest idea,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter.

=E2=80=98Nor I,=E2=80=99 said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. =E2=80=98I think you might do something better with t=
he
time,=E2=80=99 she said, =E2=80=98than waste it in asking riddles that have=
 no answers.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98If you knew Time as well as I do,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter, =E2=80=
=98you wouldn=E2=80=99t talk
about wasting IT. It=E2=80=99s HIM.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t know what you mean,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Of course you don=E2=80=99t!=E2=80=99 the Hatter said, tossing his=
 head contemptuously.
=E2=80=98I dare say you never even spoke to Time!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Perhaps not,=E2=80=99 Alice cautiously replied: =E2=80=98but I kno=
w I have to beat time
when I learn music.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Ah! that accounts for it,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter. =E2=80=98He wo=
n=E2=80=99t stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he=E2=80=99d do almost anythi=
ng
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o=E2=80=99cloc=
k in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you=E2=80=99d only have to whisper=
 a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!=E2=80=99

[=E2=80=98I only wish it was,=E2=80=99 the March Hare said to itself in a w=
hisper.)

=E2=80=98That would be grand, certainly,=E2=80=99 said Alice thoughtfully: =
=E2=80=98but then--I
shouldn=E2=80=99t be hungry for it, you know.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Not at first, perhaps,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter: =E2=80=98but you =
could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Is that the way YOU manage?=E2=80=99 Alice asked.

The Hatter shook his head mournfully. =E2=80=98Not I!=E2=80=99 he replied. =
=E2=80=98We
quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--=E2=80=99 (pointi=
ng
with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) =E2=80=98--it was at the great conce=
rt
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

     =E2=80=9CTwinkle, twinkle, little bat!
     How I wonder what you=E2=80=99re at!=E2=80=9D

You know the song, perhaps?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ve heard something like it,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98It goes on, you know,=E2=80=99 the Hatter continued, =E2=80=98in t=
his way:--

     =E2=80=9CUp above the world you fly,
     Like a tea-tray in the sky.
         Twinkle, twinkle--=E2=80=9C=E2=80=99

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep =E2=80=98Twi=
nkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--=E2=80=99 and went on so long that they had to p=
inch
it to make it stop.

=E2=80=98Well, I=E2=80=99d hardly finished the first verse,=E2=80=99 said t=
he Hatter, =E2=80=98when the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, =E2=80=9CHe=E2=80=99s murdering the time! O=
ff with his
head!=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98How dreadfully savage!=E2=80=99 exclaimed Alice.

=E2=80=98And ever since that,=E2=80=99 the Hatter went on in a mournful ton=
e, =E2=80=98he won=E2=80=99t
do a thing I ask! It=E2=80=99s always six o=E2=80=99clock now.=E2=80=99

A bright idea came into Alice=E2=80=99s head. =E2=80=98Is that the reason s=
o many
tea-things are put out here?=E2=80=99 she asked.

=E2=80=98Yes, that=E2=80=99s it,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter with a sigh: =E2=
=80=98it=E2=80=99s always tea-time,
and we=E2=80=99ve no time to wash the things between whiles.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Then you keep moving round, I suppose?=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Exactly so,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter: =E2=80=98as the things get u=
sed up.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98But what happens when you come to the beginning again?=E2=80=99 Al=
ice ventured
to ask.

=E2=80=98Suppose we change the subject,=E2=80=99 the March Hare interrupted=
, yawning.
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us =
a story.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m afraid I don=E2=80=99t know one,=E2=80=99 said Alice, =
rather alarmed at the
proposal.

=E2=80=98Then the Dormouse shall!=E2=80=99 they both cried. =E2=80=98Wake u=
p, Dormouse!=E2=80=99 And
they pinched it on both sides at once.

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. =E2=80=98I wasn=E2=80=99t asleep,=E2=
=80=99 he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: =E2=80=98I heard every word you fellows were saying.=
=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Tell us a story!=E2=80=99 said the March Hare.

=E2=80=98Yes, please do!=E2=80=99 pleaded Alice.

=E2=80=98And be quick about it,=E2=80=99 added the Hatter, =E2=80=98or you=
=E2=80=99ll be asleep again
before it=E2=80=99s done.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Once upon a time there were three little sisters,=E2=80=99 the Dor=
mouse began
in a great hurry; =E2=80=98and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; a=
nd
they lived at the bottom of a well--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98What did they live on?=E2=80=99 said Alice, who always took a grea=
t interest in
questions of eating and drinking.

=E2=80=98They lived on treacle,=E2=80=99 said the Dormouse, after thinking =
a minute or
two.

=E2=80=98They couldn=E2=80=99t have done that, you know,=E2=80=99 Alice gen=
tly remarked; =E2=80=98they=E2=80=99d
have been ill.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98So they were,=E2=80=99 said the Dormouse; =E2=80=98VERY ill.=E2=80=
=99

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: =E2=80=
=98But
why did they live at the bottom of a well?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Take some more tea,=E2=80=99 the March Hare said to Alice, very ea=
rnestly.

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ve had nothing yet,=E2=80=99 Alice replied in an offende=
d tone, =E2=80=98so I can=E2=80=99t
take more.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98You mean you can=E2=80=99t take LESS,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter: =
=E2=80=98it=E2=80=99s very easy to take
MORE than nothing.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Nobody asked YOUR opinion,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Who=E2=80=99s making personal remarks now?=E2=80=99 the Hatter ask=
ed triumphantly.

Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question. =E2=80=98Why did they live at the bottom of a well?=
=E2=80=99

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, =E2=80=98It was a treacle-well.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98There=E2=80=99s no such thing!=E2=80=99 Alice was beginning very a=
ngrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went =E2=80=98Sh! sh!=E2=80=99 and the Dormouse s=
ulkily
remarked, =E2=80=98If you can=E2=80=99t be civil, you=E2=80=99d better fini=
sh the story for
yourself.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98No, please go on!=E2=80=99 Alice said very humbly; =E2=80=98I won=
=E2=80=99t interrupt again. I
dare say there may be ONE.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98One, indeed!=E2=80=99 said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he c=
onsented to
go on. =E2=80=98And so these three little sisters--they were learning to dr=
aw,
you know--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98What did they draw?=E2=80=99 said Alice, quite forgetting her prom=
ise.

=E2=80=98Treacle,=E2=80=99 said the Dormouse, without considering at all th=
is time.

=E2=80=98I want a clean cup,=E2=80=99 interrupted the Hatter: =E2=80=98let=
=E2=80=99s all move one place
on.=E2=80=99

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouse=E2=80=99s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took
the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: =E2=80=98But I don=E2=80=99t understand. Where did they draw th=
e treacle
from?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98You can draw water out of a water-well,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter; =
=E2=80=98so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98But they were IN the well,=E2=80=99 Alice said to the Dormouse, no=
t choosing to
notice this last remark.

=E2=80=98Of course they were=E2=80=99, said the Dormouse; =E2=80=98--well i=
n.=E2=80=99

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

=E2=80=98They were learning to draw,=E2=80=99 the Dormouse went on, yawning=
 and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; =E2=80=98and they drew all manner=
 of
things--everything that begins with an M--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Why with an M?=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Why not?=E2=80=99 said the March Hare.

Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into
a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with
a little shriek, and went on: =E2=80=98--that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
things are =E2=80=9Cmuch of a muchness=E2=80=9D--did you ever see such a th=
ing as a
drawing of a muchness?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Really, now you ask me,=E2=80=99 said Alice, very much confused, =
=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t
think--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Then you shouldn=E2=80=99t talk,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.

=E2=80=98At any rate I=E2=80=99ll never go THERE again!=E2=80=99 said Alice=
 as she picked her
way through the wood. =E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s the stupidest tea-party I ever =
was at in all
my life!=E2=80=99

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s very curious!=E2=80=99 she t=
hought. =E2=80=98But
everything=E2=80=99s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.=E2=
=80=99 And in
she went.

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table. =E2=80=98Now, I=E2=80=99ll manage better this time,=E2=80=99 s=
he said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she
had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:
then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at
last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool
fountains.




CHAPTER VIII. The Queen=E2=80=99s Croquet-Ground

A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went
nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of
them say, =E2=80=98Look out now, Five! Don=E2=80=99t go splashing paint ove=
r me like
that!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I couldn=E2=80=99t help it,=E2=80=99 said Five, in a sulky tone; =
=E2=80=98Seven jogged my
elbow.=E2=80=99

On which Seven looked up and said, =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s right, Five! Alw=
ays lay the
blame on others!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98YOU=E2=80=99D better not talk!=E2=80=99 said Five. =E2=80=98I hear=
d the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98What for?=E2=80=99 said the one who had spoken first.

=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s none of YOUR business, Two!=E2=80=99 said Seven.

=E2=80=98Yes, it IS his business!=E2=80=99 said Five, =E2=80=98and I=E2=80=
=99ll tell him--it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.=E2=80=99

Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun =E2=80=98Well, of all the un=
just
things--=E2=80=99 when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood wat=
ching
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and
all of them bowed low.

=E2=80=98Would you tell me,=E2=80=99 said Alice, a little timidly, =E2=80=
=98why you are painting
those roses?=E2=80=99

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, =E2=80=98Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have bee=
n a
RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
So you see, Miss, we=E2=80=99re doing our best, afore she comes, to--=E2=80=
=99 At this
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out =E2=80=98The Queen! The Queen!=E2=80=99 and the three gardeners instant=
ly threw
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like
the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented
with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among
them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried
nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King=E2=80=99=
s
crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; =E2=80=98and besides, what would be the use =
of
a procession,=E2=80=99 thought she, =E2=80=98if people had all to lie down =
upon their
faces, so that they couldn=E2=80=99t see it?=E2=80=99 So she stood still wh=
ere she was,
and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely =E2=80=98Who is this?=E2=80=99 She said=
 it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

=E2=80=98Idiot!=E2=80=99 said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,=
 turning to
Alice, she went on, =E2=80=98What=E2=80=99s your name, child?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,=E2=80=99 said Alice very=
 politely;
but she added, to herself, =E2=80=98Why, they=E2=80=99re only a pack of car=
ds, after
all. I needn=E2=80=99t be afraid of them!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98And who are THESE?=E2=80=99 said the Queen, pointing to the three =
gardeners who
were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their
faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the
pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or
courtiers, or three of her own children.

=E2=80=98How should I know?=E2=80=99 said Alice, surprised at her own coura=
ge. =E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s no
business of MINE.=E2=80=99

The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed =E2=80=98Off with her head! Off--=E2=80=
=99

=E2=80=98Nonsense!=E2=80=99 said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the =
Queen was
silent.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said =E2=80=98Consider, my
dear: she is only a child!=E2=80=99

The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave =E2=80=98Turn=
 them
over!=E2=80=99

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

=E2=80=98Get up!=E2=80=99 said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the =
three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.

=E2=80=98Leave off that!=E2=80=99 screamed the Queen. =E2=80=98You make me =
giddy.=E2=80=99 And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, =E2=80=98What HAVE you been doing he=
re?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98May it please your Majesty,=E2=80=99 said Two, in a very humble to=
ne, going
down on one knee as he spoke, =E2=80=98we were trying--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I see!=E2=80=99 said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining t=
he roses.
=E2=80=98Off with their heads!=E2=80=99 and the procession moved on, three =
of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.

=E2=80=98You shan=E2=80=99t be beheaded!=E2=80=99 said Alice, and she put t=
hem into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.

=E2=80=98Are their heads off?=E2=80=99 shouted the Queen.

=E2=80=98Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!=E2=80=99 the sold=
iers shouted
in reply.

=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s right!=E2=80=99 shouted the Queen. =E2=80=98Can you=
 play croquet?=E2=80=99

The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.

=E2=80=98Yes!=E2=80=99 shouted Alice.

=E2=80=98Come on, then!=E2=80=99 roared the Queen, and Alice joined the pro=
cession,
wondering very much what would happen next.

=E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s--it=E2=80=99s a very fine day!=E2=80=99 said a timid =
voice at her side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

=E2=80=98Very,=E2=80=99 said Alice: =E2=80=98--where=E2=80=99s the Duchess?=
=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Hush! Hush!=E2=80=99 said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He lo=
oked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered =E2=80=98She=E2=80=99=
s under
sentence of execution.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98What for?=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Did you say =E2=80=9CWhat a pity!=E2=80=9D?=E2=80=99 the Rabbit as=
ked.

=E2=80=98No, I didn=E2=80=99t,=E2=80=99 said Alice: =E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99=
t think it=E2=80=99s at all a pity. I said
=E2=80=9CWhat for?=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98She boxed the Queen=E2=80=99s ears--=E2=80=99 the Rabbit began. Al=
ice gave a little
scream of laughter. =E2=80=98Oh, hush!=E2=80=99 the Rabbit whispered in a f=
rightened
tone. =E2=80=98The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and =
the
Queen said--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Get to your places!=E2=80=99 shouted the Queen in a voice of thund=
er, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,
the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves
up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under
her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got
its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a
blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,
with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out
laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin
again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was
generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the
hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up
and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the
conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short
time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting =E2=80=98Off with his head!=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98Off with her head=
!=E2=80=99 about once in a
minute.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
=E2=80=98and then,=E2=80=99 thought she, =E2=80=98what would become of me? =
They=E2=80=99re dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there=E2=80=99s an=
y one
left alive!=E2=80=99

She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance
in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it
a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself
=E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk t=
o.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98How are you getting on?=E2=80=99 said the Cat, as soon as there wa=
s mouth
enough for it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. =E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s=
 no use
speaking to it,=E2=80=99 she thought, =E2=80=98till its ears have come, or =
at least one
of them.=E2=80=99 In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice=
 put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was
enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t think they play at all fairly,=E2=80=99 Alice bega=
n, in rather a
complaining tone, =E2=80=98and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can=E2=80=
=99t hear
oneself speak--and they don=E2=80=99t seem to have any rules in particular;
at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you=E2=80=99ve no idea =
how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there=E2=80=99s t=
he
arch I=E2=80=99ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of =
the
ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen=E2=80=99s hedgehog just now, =
only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98How do you like the Queen?=E2=80=99 said the Cat in a low voice.

=E2=80=98Not at all,=E2=80=99 said Alice: =E2=80=98she=E2=80=99s so extreme=
ly--=E2=80=99 Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
=E2=80=98--likely to win, that it=E2=80=99s hardly worth while finishing th=
e game.=E2=80=99

The Queen smiled and passed on.

=E2=80=98Who ARE you talking to?=E2=80=99 said the King, going up to Alice,=
 and looking
at the Cat=E2=80=99s head with great curiosity.

=E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,=E2=80=99 said Alice=
: =E2=80=98allow me to
introduce it.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t like the look of it at all,=E2=80=99 said the King=
: =E2=80=98however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99d rather not,=E2=80=99 the Cat remarked.

=E2=80=98Don=E2=80=99t be impertinent,=E2=80=99 said the King, =E2=80=98and=
 don=E2=80=99t look at me like that!=E2=80=99
He got behind Alice as he spoke.

=E2=80=98A cat may look at a king,=E2=80=99 said Alice. =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99=
ve read that in some book,
but I don=E2=80=99t remember where.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Well, it must be removed,=E2=80=99 said the King very decidedly, a=
nd he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, =E2=80=98My dear! I wish you woul=
d
have this cat removed!=E2=80=99

The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.
=E2=80=98Off with his head!=E2=80=99 she said, without even looking round.

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ll fetch the executioner myself,=E2=80=99 said the King =
eagerly, and he
hurried off.

Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queen=E2=80=99s voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: =E2=80=98but it doesn=
=E2=80=99t
matter much,=E2=80=99 thought Alice, =E2=80=98as all the arches are gone fr=
om this side
of the ground.=E2=80=99 So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might =
not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a
large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

The executioner=E2=80=99s argument was, that you couldn=E2=80=99t cut off a=
 head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn=E2=80=99t going to begin at HIS time of life.

The King=E2=80=99s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren=E2=80=99t to talk nonsense.

The Queen=E2=80=99s argument was, that if something wasn=E2=80=99t done abo=
ut it in less
than no time she=E2=80=99d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this=
 last
remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but =E2=80=98It belongs to the Duc=
hess:
you=E2=80=99d better ask HER about it.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98She=E2=80=99s in prison,=E2=80=99 the Queen said to the executione=
r: =E2=80=98fetch her here.=E2=80=99
And the executioner went off like an arrow.

 The Cat=E2=80=99s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely
disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down
looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.




CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle=E2=80=99s Story

=E2=80=98You can=E2=80=99t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear o=
ld thing!=E2=80=99
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice=E2=80=99s=
, and
they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

=E2=80=98When I=E2=80=99M a Duchess,=E2=80=99 she said to herself, (not in =
a very hopeful tone
though), =E2=80=98I won=E2=80=99t have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Sou=
p does very
well without--Maybe it=E2=80=99s always pepper that makes people hot-temper=
ed,=E2=80=99
she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of
rule, =E2=80=98and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes
them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn=E2=80=99t be=
 so
stingy about it, you know--=E2=80=99

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. =E2=80=98You=E2=80=99re=
 thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can=E2=80=99=
t
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Perhaps it hasn=E2=80=99t one,=E2=80=99 Alice ventured to remark.

=E2=80=98Tut, tut, child!=E2=80=99 said the Duchess. =E2=80=98Everything=E2=
=80=99s got a moral, if only
you can find it.=E2=80=99 And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice=E2=80=
=99s side as
she spoke.

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice=E2=80=99s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

=E2=80=98The game=E2=80=99s going on rather better now,=E2=80=99 she said, =
by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.

=E2=80=98=E2=80=99Tis so,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess: =E2=80=98and the moral=
 of that is--=E2=80=9COh, =E2=80=98tis love,
=E2=80=98tis love, that makes the world go round!=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Somebody said,=E2=80=99 Alice whispered, =E2=80=98that it=E2=80=99=
s done by everybody minding
their own business!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Ah, well! It means much the same thing,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess,=
 digging her
sharp little chin into Alice=E2=80=99s shoulder as she added, =E2=80=98and =
the moral
of THAT is--=E2=80=9CTake care of the sense, and the sounds will take care =
of
themselves.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98How fond she is of finding morals in things!=E2=80=99 Alice though=
t to herself.

=E2=80=98I dare say you=E2=80=99re wondering why I don=E2=80=99t put my arm=
 round your waist,=E2=80=99
the Duchess said after a pause: =E2=80=98the reason is, that I=E2=80=99m do=
ubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98HE might bite,=E2=80=99 Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at a=
ll anxious to
have the experiment tried.

=E2=80=98Very true,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess: =E2=80=98flamingoes and must=
ard both bite. And
the moral of that is--=E2=80=9CBirds of a feather flock together.=E2=80=9D=
=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Only mustard isn=E2=80=99t a bird,=E2=80=99 Alice remarked.

=E2=80=98Right, as usual,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess: =E2=80=98what a clear =
way you have of
putting things!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s a mineral, I THINK,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Of course it is,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess, who seemed ready to ag=
ree to
everything that Alice said; =E2=80=98there=E2=80=99s a large mustard-mine n=
ear here. And
the moral of that is--=E2=80=9CThe more there is of mine, the less there is=
 of
yours.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Oh, I know!=E2=80=99 exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this=
 last remark,
=E2=80=98it=E2=80=99s a vegetable. It doesn=E2=80=99t look like one, but it=
 is.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I quite agree with you,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess; =E2=80=98and th=
e moral of that
is--=E2=80=9CBe what you would seem to be=E2=80=9D--or if you=E2=80=99d lik=
e it put more
simply--=E2=80=9CNever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it mi=
ght
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.=E2=80=
=9D=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I think I should understand that better,=E2=80=99 Alice said very =
politely, =E2=80=98if
I had it written down: but I can=E2=80=99t quite follow it as you say it.=
=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s nothing to what I could say if I chose,=E2=80=99 th=
e Duchess replied, in
a pleased tone.

=E2=80=98Pray don=E2=80=99t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that=
,=E2=80=99 said
Alice.

=E2=80=98Oh, don=E2=80=99t talk about trouble!=E2=80=99 said the Duchess. =
=E2=80=98I make you a present
of everything I=E2=80=99ve said as yet.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98A cheap sort of present!=E2=80=99 thought Alice. =E2=80=98I=E2=80=
=99m glad they don=E2=80=99t give
birthday presents like that!=E2=80=99 But she did not venture to say it out
loud.

=E2=80=98Thinking again?=E2=80=99 the Duchess asked, with another dig of he=
r sharp
little chin.

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ve a right to think,=E2=80=99 said Alice sharply, for sh=
e was beginning to
feel a little worried.

=E2=80=98Just about as much right,=E2=80=99 said the Duchess, =E2=80=98as p=
igs have to fly; and
the m--=E2=80=99

But here, to Alice=E2=80=99s great surprise, the Duchess=E2=80=99s voice di=
ed away, even
in the middle of her favourite word =E2=80=98moral,=E2=80=99 and the arm th=
at was linked
into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen
in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.

=E2=80=98A fine day, your Majesty!=E2=80=99 the Duchess began in a low, wea=
k voice.

=E2=80=98Now, I give you fair warning,=E2=80=99 shouted the Queen, stamping=
 on the
ground as she spoke; =E2=80=98either you or your head must be off, and that=
 in
about half no time! Take your choice!=E2=80=99

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

=E2=80=98Let=E2=80=99s go on with the game,=E2=80=99 the Queen said to Alic=
e; and Alice was
too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen=E2=80=99s absence, and we=
re
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment=E2=80=99s delay =
would
cost them their lives.

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with
the other players, and shouting =E2=80=98Off with his head!=E2=80=99 or =E2=
=80=98Off with her
head!=E2=80=99 Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the sold=
iers,
who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by
the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and
under sentence of execution.

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, =E2=80=98H=
ave
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98No,=E2=80=99 said Alice. =E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t even know what a=
 Mock Turtle is.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,=E2=80=99 sai=
d the Queen.

=E2=80=98I never saw one, or heard of one,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Come on, then,=E2=80=99 said the Queen, =E2=80=98and he shall tell=
 you his history,=E2=80=99

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, =E2=80=98You are all pardoned.=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98=
Come, THAT=E2=80=99S a good
thing!=E2=80=99 she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.
(IF you don=E2=80=99t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) =E2=80=
=98Up, lazy
thing!=E2=80=99 said the Queen, =E2=80=98and take this young lady to see th=
e Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered=E2=80=99; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone=
 with
the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on
the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
after that savage Queen: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. =E2=80=98What fun!=E2=80=99 said th=
e Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

=E2=80=98What IS the fun?=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Why, SHE,=E2=80=99 said the Gryphon. =E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s all her=
 fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Everybody says =E2=80=9Ccome on!=E2=80=9D here,=E2=80=99 thought A=
lice, as she went slowly
after it: =E2=80=98I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!=E2=
=80=99

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
pitied him deeply. =E2=80=98What is his sorrow?=E2=80=99 she asked the Gryp=
hon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, =E2=80=98It=E2=
=80=99s all his
fancy, that: he hasn=E2=80=99t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!=E2=80=99

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

=E2=80=98This here young lady,=E2=80=99 said the Gryphon, =E2=80=98she want=
s for to know your
history, she do.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ll tell it her,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtle in a deep,=
 hollow tone: =E2=80=98sit
down, both of you, and don=E2=80=99t speak a word till I=E2=80=99ve finishe=
d.=E2=80=99

So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, =E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn=
=E2=80=99t begin.=E2=80=99 But
she waited patiently.

=E2=80=98Once,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, =E2=
=80=98I was a real
Turtle.=E2=80=99

These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of =E2=80=98Hjckrrh!=E2=80=99 from the Gryphon, and =
the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, =E2=80=98Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,=E2=80=99 but s=
he could
not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

=E2=80=98When we were little,=E2=80=99 the Mock Turtle went on at last, mor=
e calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, =E2=80=98we went to school in t=
he
sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn=E2=80=99t one?=E2=80=99 =
Alice asked.

=E2=80=98We called him Tortoise because he taught us,=E2=80=99 said the Moc=
k Turtle
angrily: =E2=80=98really you are very dull!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple quest=
ion,=E2=80=99
added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said
to the Mock Turtle, =E2=80=98Drive on, old fellow! Don=E2=80=99t be all day=
 about it!=E2=80=99
and he went on in these words:

=E2=80=98Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn=E2=80=99t belie=
ve it--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I never said I didn=E2=80=99t!=E2=80=99 interrupted Alice.

=E2=80=98You did,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtle.

=E2=80=98Hold your tongue!=E2=80=99 added the Gryphon, before Alice could s=
peak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.

=E2=80=98We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every da=
y--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99VE been to a day-school, too,=E2=80=99 said Alice; =E2=
=80=98you needn=E2=80=99t be so proud
as all that.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98With extras?=E2=80=99 asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

=E2=80=98Yes,=E2=80=99 said Alice, =E2=80=98we learned French and music.=E2=
=80=99

=E2=80=98And washing?=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtle.

=E2=80=98Certainly not!=E2=80=99 said Alice indignantly.

=E2=80=98Ah! then yours wasn=E2=80=99t a really good school,=E2=80=99 said =
the Mock Turtle in
a tone of great relief. =E2=80=98Now at OURS they had at the end of the bil=
l,
=E2=80=9CFrench, music, AND WASHING--extra.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98You couldn=E2=80=99t have wanted it much,=E2=80=99 said Alice; =E2=
=80=98living at the bottom of
the sea.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I couldn=E2=80=99t afford to learn it.=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turt=
le with a sigh. =E2=80=98I
only took the regular course.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98What was that?=E2=80=99 inquired Alice.

=E2=80=98Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,=E2=80=99 the Mock =
Turtle
replied; =E2=80=98and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I never heard of =E2=80=9CUglification,=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99 Alice ve=
ntured to say. =E2=80=98What is it?=E2=80=99

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. =E2=80=98What! Never heard=
 of
uglifying!=E2=80=99 it exclaimed. =E2=80=98You know what to beautify is, I =
suppose?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Yes,=E2=80=99 said Alice doubtfully: =E2=80=98it means--to--make--=
anything--prettier.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Well, then,=E2=80=99 the Gryphon went on, =E2=80=98if you don=E2=
=80=99t know what to uglify is,
you ARE a simpleton.=E2=80=99

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
turned to the Mock Turtle, and said =E2=80=98What else had you to learn?=E2=
=80=99

=E2=80=98Well, there was Mystery,=E2=80=99 the Mock Turtle replied, countin=
g off
the subjects on his flappers, =E2=80=98--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98What was THAT like?=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Well, I can=E2=80=99t show it you myself,=E2=80=99 the Mock Turtle=
 said: =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Hadn=E2=80=99t time,=E2=80=99 said the Gryphon: =E2=80=98I went to=
 the Classics master, though.
He was an old crab, HE was.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I never went to him,=E2=80=99 the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: =
=E2=80=98he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98So he did, so he did,=E2=80=99 said the Gryphon, sighing in his tu=
rn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

=E2=80=98And how many hours a day did you do lessons?=E2=80=99 said Alice, =
in a hurry to
change the subject.

=E2=80=98Ten hours the first day,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtle: =E2=80=98n=
ine the next, and so
on.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98What a curious plan!=E2=80=99 exclaimed Alice.

=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s the reason they=E2=80=99re called lessons,=E2=80=99=
 the Gryphon remarked:
=E2=80=98because they lessen from day to day.=E2=80=99

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. =E2=80=98Then the eleventh day must have b=
een a
holiday?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Of course it was,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtle.

=E2=80=98And how did you manage on the twelfth?=E2=80=99 Alice went on eage=
rly.

=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s enough about lessons,=E2=80=99 the Gryphon interrup=
ted in a very decided
tone: =E2=80=98tell her something about the games now.=E2=80=99




CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. =E2=80=98Same as if he had a bone in his throat,=
=E2=80=99
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:--

=E2=80=98You may not have lived much under the sea--=E2=80=99 [=E2=80=98I h=
aven=E2=80=99t,=E2=80=99 said
Alice)--=E2=80=98and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--=
=E2=80=99
(Alice began to say =E2=80=98I once tasted--=E2=80=99 but checked herself h=
astily, and
said =E2=80=98No, never=E2=80=99) =E2=80=98--so you can have no idea what a=
 delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98No, indeed,=E2=80=99 said Alice. =E2=80=98What sort of a dance is =
it?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Why,=E2=80=99 said the Gryphon, =E2=80=98you first form into a lin=
e along the
sea-shore--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Two lines!=E2=80=99 cried the Mock Turtle. =E2=80=98Seals, turtles=
, salmon, and so on;
then, when you=E2=80=99ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--=E2=80=
=99

=E2=80=98THAT generally takes some time,=E2=80=99 interrupted the Gryphon.

=E2=80=98--you advance twice--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Each with a lobster as a partner!=E2=80=99 cried the Gryphon.

=E2=80=98Of course,=E2=80=99 the Mock Turtle said: =E2=80=98advance twice, =
set to partners--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98--change lobsters, and retire in same order,=E2=80=99 continued th=
e Gryphon.

=E2=80=98Then, you know,=E2=80=99 the Mock Turtle went on, =E2=80=98you thr=
ow the--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98The lobsters!=E2=80=99 shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the =
air.

=E2=80=98--as far out to sea as you can--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Swim after them!=E2=80=99 screamed the Gryphon.

=E2=80=98Turn a somersault in the sea!=E2=80=99 cried the Mock Turtle, cape=
ring wildly
about.

=E2=80=98Change lobsters again!=E2=80=99 yelled the Gryphon at the top of i=
ts voice.

=E2=80=98Back to land again, and that=E2=80=99s all the first figure,=E2=80=
=99 said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
and quietly, and looked at Alice.

=E2=80=98It must be a very pretty dance,=E2=80=99 said Alice timidly.

=E2=80=98Would you like to see a little of it?=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtl=
e.

=E2=80=98Very much indeed,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Come, let=E2=80=99s try the first figure!=E2=80=99 said the Mock T=
urtle to the Gryphon.
=E2=80=98We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Oh, YOU sing,=E2=80=99 said the Gryphon. =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ve for=
gotten the words.=E2=80=99

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:--

 =E2=80=98=E2=80=9CWill you walk a little faster?=E2=80=9D said a whiting t=
o a snail.
 =E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s a porpoise close behind us, and he=E2=80=99s trea=
ding on my tail.

 See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
 They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?

 Will you, won=E2=80=99t you, will you, won=E2=80=99t you, will you join th=
e dance?
 Will you, won=E2=80=99t you, will you, won=E2=80=99t you, won=E2=80=99t yo=
u join the dance?

 =E2=80=9CYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be
 When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!=E2=80=9D
  But the snail replied =E2=80=9CToo far, too far!=E2=80=9D and gave a look=
 askance--
 Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.

 Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
 Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

 =E2=80=98=E2=80=9CWhat matters it how far we go?=E2=80=9D his scaly friend=
 replied.
 =E2=80=9CThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
 The further off from England the nearer is to France--
 Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.

 Will you, won=E2=80=99t you, will you, won=E2=80=99t you, will you join th=
e dance?
 Will you, won=E2=80=99t you, will you, won=E2=80=99t you, won=E2=80=99t yo=
u join the dance?=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Thank you, it=E2=80=99s a very interesting dance to watch,=E2=80=
=99 said Alice, feeling
very glad that it was over at last: =E2=80=98and I do so like that curious =
song
about the whiting!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Oh, as to the whiting,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtle, =E2=80=98the=
y--you=E2=80=99ve seen them,
of course?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Yes,=E2=80=99 said Alice, =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ve often seen them at=
 dinn--=E2=80=99 she checked herself
hastily.

=E2=80=98I don=E2=80=99t know where Dinn may be,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Tur=
tle, =E2=80=98but if you=E2=80=99ve
seen them so often, of course you know what they=E2=80=99re like.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I believe so,=E2=80=99 Alice replied thoughtfully. =E2=80=98They h=
ave their tails in
their mouths--and they=E2=80=99re all over crumbs.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98You=E2=80=99re wrong about the crumbs,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turt=
le: =E2=80=98crumbs would all
wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the
reason is--=E2=80=99 here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--=E2=80=
=98Tell her
about the reason and all that,=E2=80=99 he said to the Gryphon.

=E2=80=98The reason is,=E2=80=99 said the Gryphon, =E2=80=98that they WOULD=
 go with the lobsters
to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long
way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn=E2=80=99t=
 get
them out again. That=E2=80=99s all.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Thank you,=E2=80=99 said Alice, =E2=80=98it=E2=80=99s very interes=
ting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I can tell you more than that, if you like,=E2=80=99 said the Gryp=
hon. =E2=80=98Do you
know why it=E2=80=99s called a whiting?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I never thought about it,=E2=80=99 said Alice. =E2=80=98Why?=E2=80=
=99

=E2=80=98IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.=E2=80=99 the Gryphon replied very sol=
emnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. =E2=80=98Does the boots and shoes!=E2=80=99 s=
he repeated
in a wondering tone.

=E2=80=98Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?=E2=80=99 said the Gryphon. =E2=
=80=98I mean, what
makes them so shiny?=E2=80=99

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. =E2=80=98They=E2=80=99re done with blacking, I believe.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Boots and shoes under the sea,=E2=80=99 the Gryphon went on in a d=
eep voice,
=E2=80=98are done with a whiting. Now you know.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98And what are they made of?=E2=80=99 Alice asked in a tone of great=
 curiosity.

=E2=80=98Soles and eels, of course,=E2=80=99 the Gryphon replied rather imp=
atiently:
=E2=80=98any shrimp could have told you that.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98If I=E2=80=99d been the whiting,=E2=80=99 said Alice, whose though=
ts were still running
on the song, =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99d have said to the porpoise, =E2=80=9CKeep =
back, please: we
don=E2=80=99t want YOU with us!=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98They were obliged to have him with them,=E2=80=99 the Mock Turtle =
said: =E2=80=98no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Wouldn=E2=80=99t it really?=E2=80=99 said Alice in a tone of great=
 surprise.

=E2=80=98Of course not,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtle: =E2=80=98why, if a f=
ish came to ME, and
told me he was going a journey, I should say =E2=80=9CWith what porpoise?=
=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Don=E2=80=99t you mean =E2=80=9Cpurpose=E2=80=9D?=E2=80=99 said Al=
ice.

=E2=80=98I mean what I say,=E2=80=99 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended=
 tone. And
the Gryphon added =E2=80=98Come, let=E2=80=99s hear some of YOUR adventures=
.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,=E2=80=
=99 said
Alice a little timidly: =E2=80=98but it=E2=80=99s no use going back to yest=
erday,
because I was a different person then.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Explain all that,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtle.

=E2=80=98No, no! The adventures first,=E2=80=99 said the Gryphon in an impa=
tient tone:
=E2=80=98explanations take such a dreadful time.=E2=80=99

So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went
on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her repeating =E2=80=98YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,=E2=80=99 to the Caterpi=
llar, and the
words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
and said =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s very curious.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s all about as curious as it can be,=E2=80=99 said the =
Gryphon.

=E2=80=98It all came different!=E2=80=99 the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfu=
lly. =E2=80=98I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin.=E2=80=99 He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind =
of
authority over Alice.

=E2=80=98Stand up and repeat =E2=80=9C=E2=80=98TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGAR=
D,=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99 said the
Gryphon.

=E2=80=98How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!=E2=
=80=99
thought Alice; =E2=80=98I might as well be at school at once.=E2=80=99 Howe=
ver, she
got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:--

  =E2=80=98=E2=80=99Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
  =E2=80=9CYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.=E2=80=9D
   As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.=E2=80=99

       [later editions continued as follows
  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]

=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s different from what I used to say when I was a chil=
d,=E2=80=99 said the
Gryphon.

=E2=80=98Well, I never heard it before,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtle; =E2=
=80=98but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.=E2=80=99

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.

=E2=80=98I should like to have it explained,=E2=80=99 said the Mock Turtle.

=E2=80=98She can=E2=80=99t explain it,=E2=80=99 said the Gryphon hastily. =
=E2=80=98Go on with the next
verse.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98But about his toes?=E2=80=99 the Mock Turtle persisted. =E2=80=98H=
ow COULD he turn them
out with his nose, you know?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s the first position in dancing.=E2=80=99 Alice said; b=
ut was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

=E2=80=98Go on with the next verse,=E2=80=99 the Gryphon repeated impatient=
ly: =E2=80=98it
begins =E2=80=9CI passed by his garden.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=99

Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--

  =E2=80=98I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--=E2=80=99

    [later editions continued as follows
  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
  And concluded the banquet--]

=E2=80=98What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,=E2=80=99 the Mock Tur=
tle
interrupted, =E2=80=98if you don=E2=80=99t explain it as you go on? It=E2=
=80=99s by far the most
confusing thing I ever heard!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Yes, I think you=E2=80=99d better leave off,=E2=80=99 said the Gry=
phon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.

=E2=80=98Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?=E2=80=99 the=
 Gryphon went
on. =E2=80=98Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,=E2=80=99 =
Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
=E2=80=98Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her =E2=80=9CTurtle Soup,=E2=80=
=9D will you, old
fellow?=E2=80=99

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:--

   =E2=80=98Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
   Waiting in a hot tureen!
   Who for such dainties would not stoop?
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

   =E2=80=98Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
   Game, or any other dish?
   Who would not give all else for two
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Chorus again!=E2=80=99 cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had =
just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of =E2=80=98The trial=E2=80=99s beginning!=E2=80=
=99 was heard in the
distance.

=E2=80=98Come on!=E2=80=99 cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand=
, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

=E2=80=98What trial is it?=E2=80=99 Alice panted as she ran; but the Grypho=
n only
answered =E2=80=98Come on!=E2=80=99 and ran the faster, while more and more=
 faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--

   =E2=80=98Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!=E2=80=99




CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?

The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,
and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court
was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,
that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--=E2=80=98I wish they=E2=80=
=99d get the
trial done,=E2=80=99 she thought, =E2=80=98and hand round the refreshments!=
=E2=80=99 But there
seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s the judge,=E2=
=80=99 she said to
herself, =E2=80=98because of his great wig.=E2=80=99

The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did
not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

=E2=80=98And that=E2=80=99s the jury-box,=E2=80=99 thought Alice, =E2=80=98=
and those twelve creatures,=E2=80=99
(she was obliged to say =E2=80=98creatures,=E2=80=99 you see, because some =
of them were
animals, and some were birds,) =E2=80=98I suppose they are the jurors.=E2=
=80=99 She said
this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her
age knew the meaning of it at all. However, =E2=80=98jury-men=E2=80=99 woul=
d have done
just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. =E2=80=98What are=
 they
doing?=E2=80=99 Alice whispered to the Gryphon. =E2=80=98They can=E2=80=99t=
 have anything to put
down yet, before the trial=E2=80=99s begun.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98They=E2=80=99re putting down their names,=E2=80=99 the Gryphon whi=
spered in reply, =E2=80=98for
fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Stupid things!=E2=80=99 Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, bu=
t she stopped
hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, =E2=80=98Silence in the court!=E2=
=80=99 and the
King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who
was talking.

Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down =E2=80=98stupid things!=E2=80=99 on t=
heir slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn=E2=80=99t know how to spe=
ll
=E2=80=98stupid,=E2=80=99 and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.=
 =E2=80=98A nice
muddle their slates=E2=80=99ll be in before the trial=E2=80=99s over!=E2=80=
=99 thought Alice.

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

=E2=80=98Herald, read the accusation!=E2=80=99 said the King.

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--

   =E2=80=98The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
      All on a summer day:
    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
      And took them quite away!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Consider your verdict,=E2=80=99 the King said to the jury.

=E2=80=98Not yet, not yet!=E2=80=99 the Rabbit hastily interrupted. =E2=80=
=98There=E2=80=99s a great
deal to come before that!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Call the first witness,=E2=80=99 said the King; and the White Rabb=
it blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out, =E2=80=98First witness!=E2=80=99

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one
hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. =E2=80=98I beg pardon, y=
our
Majesty,=E2=80=99 he began, =E2=80=98for bringing these in: but I hadn=E2=
=80=99t quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98You ought to have finished,=E2=80=99 said the King. =E2=80=98When =
did you begin?=E2=80=99

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. =E2=80=98Fourteenth of March, I think =
it
was,=E2=80=99 he said.

=E2=80=98Fifteenth,=E2=80=99 said the March Hare.

=E2=80=98Sixteenth,=E2=80=99 added the Dormouse.

=E2=80=98Write that down,=E2=80=99 the King said to the jury, and the jury =
eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

=E2=80=98Take off your hat,=E2=80=99 the King said to the Hatter.

=E2=80=98It isn=E2=80=99t mine,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter.

=E2=80=98Stolen!=E2=80=99 the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who inst=
antly made a
memorandum of the fact.

=E2=80=98I keep them to sell,=E2=80=99 the Hatter added as an explanation; =
=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ve none of
my own. I=E2=80=99m a hatter.=E2=80=99

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.

=E2=80=98Give your evidence,=E2=80=99 said the King; =E2=80=98and don=E2=80=
=99t be nervous, or I=E2=80=99ll have
you executed on the spot.=E2=80=99

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her.

=E2=80=98I wish you wouldn=E2=80=99t squeeze so.=E2=80=99 said the Dormouse=
, who was sitting
next to her. =E2=80=98I can hardly breathe.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I can=E2=80=99t help it,=E2=80=99 said Alice very meekly: =E2=80=
=98I=E2=80=99m growing.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98You=E2=80=99ve no right to grow here,=E2=80=99 said the Dormouse.

=E2=80=98Don=E2=80=99t talk nonsense,=E2=80=99 said Alice more boldly: =E2=
=80=98you know you=E2=80=99re growing
too.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,=E2=80=99 said the Dormouse: =
=E2=80=98not in that
ridiculous fashion.=E2=80=99 And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to=
 the
other side of the court.

All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, =E2=80=98Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert=
!=E2=80=99 on
which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.

=E2=80=98Give your evidence,=E2=80=99 the King repeated angrily, =E2=80=98o=
r I=E2=80=99ll have you
executed, whether you=E2=80=99re nervous or not.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m a poor man, your Majesty,=E2=80=99 the Hatter began, i=
n a trembling voice,
=E2=80=98--and I hadn=E2=80=99t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and w=
hat with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98The twinkling of the what?=E2=80=99 said the King.

=E2=80=98It began with the tea,=E2=80=99 the Hatter replied.

=E2=80=98Of course twinkling begins with a T!=E2=80=99 said the King sharpl=
y. =E2=80=98Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m a poor man,=E2=80=99 the Hatter went on, =E2=80=98and =
most things twinkled after
that--only the March Hare said--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I didn=E2=80=99t!=E2=80=99 the March Hare interrupted in a great h=
urry.

=E2=80=98You did!=E2=80=99 said the Hatter.

=E2=80=98I deny it!=E2=80=99 said the March Hare.

=E2=80=98He denies it,=E2=80=99 said the King: =E2=80=98leave out that part=
.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--=E2=80=99 the Hatter went on=
, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

=E2=80=98After that,=E2=80=99 continued the Hatter, =E2=80=98I cut some mor=
e bread-and-butter--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98But what did the Dormouse say?=E2=80=99 one of the jury asked.

=E2=80=98That I can=E2=80=99t remember,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter.

=E2=80=98You MUST remember,=E2=80=99 remarked the King, =E2=80=98or I=E2=80=
=99ll have you executed.=E2=80=99

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m a poor man, your Majesty,=E2=80=99 h=
e began.

=E2=80=98You=E2=80=99re a very poor speaker,=E2=80=99 said the King.

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99m glad I=E2=80=99ve seen that done,=E2=80=99 thought Ali=
ce. =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ve so often read
in the newspapers, at the end of trials, =E2=80=9CThere was some attempts
at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,=E2=80=9D and I never understood what it meant till now.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98If that=E2=80=99s all you know about it, you may stand down,=E2=80=
=99 continued the
King.

=E2=80=98I can=E2=80=99t go no lower,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter: =E2=80=98I=
=E2=80=99m on the floor, as it is.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Then you may SIT down,=E2=80=99 the King replied.

Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

=E2=80=98Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!=E2=80=99 thought Alice. =E2=
=80=98Now we shall get
on better.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99d rather finish my tea,=E2=80=99 said the Hatter, with a=
n anxious look at the
Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

=E2=80=98You may go,=E2=80=99 said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left =
the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.

=E2=80=98--and just take his head off outside,=E2=80=99 the Queen added to =
one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

=E2=80=98Call the next witness!=E2=80=99 said the King.

The next witness was the Duchess=E2=80=99s cook. She carried the pepper-box=
 in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

=E2=80=98Give your evidence,=E2=80=99 said the King.

=E2=80=98Shan=E2=80=99t,=E2=80=99 said the cook.

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
=E2=80=98Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Well, if I must, I must,=E2=80=99 the King said, with a melancholy=
 air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, =E2=80=98What are tarts made =
of?=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Pepper, mostly,=E2=80=99 said the cook.

=E2=80=98Treacle,=E2=80=99 said a sleepy voice behind her.

=E2=80=98Collar that Dormouse,=E2=80=99 the Queen shrieked out. =E2=80=98Be=
head that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!=E2=80=99

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

=E2=80=98Never mind!=E2=80=99 said the King, with an air of great relief. =
=E2=80=98Call the next
witness.=E2=80=99 And he added in an undertone to the Queen, =E2=80=98Reall=
y, my dear,
YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
ache!=E2=80=99

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
curious to see what the next witness would be like, =E2=80=98--for they hav=
en=E2=80=99t
got much evidence YET,=E2=80=99 she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, =
when
the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the
name =E2=80=98Alice!=E2=80=99




CHAPTER XII. Alice=E2=80=99s Evidence


=E2=80=98Here!=E2=80=99 cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the =
moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish
she had accidentally upset the week before.

=E2=80=98Oh, I BEG your pardon!=E2=80=99 she exclaimed in a tone of great d=
ismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
they would die.

=E2=80=98The trial cannot proceed,=E2=80=99 said the King in a very grave v=
oice, =E2=80=98until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,=E2=80=99 he repeated =
with
great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got
it out again, and put it right; =E2=80=98not that it signifies much,=E2=80=
=99 she said
to herself; =E2=80=98I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the tr=
ial
one way up as the other.=E2=80=99

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.

=E2=80=98What do you know about this business?=E2=80=99 the King said to Al=
ice.

=E2=80=98Nothing,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Nothing WHATEVER?=E2=80=99 persisted the King.

=E2=80=98Nothing whatever,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s very important,=E2=80=99 the King said, turning to =
the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
interrupted: =E2=80=98UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,=E2=80=99 =
he said in a
very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.

=E2=80=98UNimportant, of course, I meant,=E2=80=99 the King hastily said, a=
nd went on
to himself in an undertone,

=E2=80=98important--unimportant--unimportant--important--=E2=80=99 as if he=
 were trying
which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down =E2=80=98important,=E2=80=99 and some =E2=80=
=98unimportant.=E2=80=99
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
=E2=80=98but it doesn=E2=80=99t matter a bit,=E2=80=99 she thought to herse=
lf.

At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out =E2=80=98Silence!=E2=80=99 and read out from his=
 book, =E2=80=98Rule
Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.=E2=80=99

Everybody looked at Alice.

=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99M not a mile high,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98You are,=E2=80=99 said the King.

=E2=80=98Nearly two miles high,=E2=80=99 added the Queen.

=E2=80=98Well, I shan=E2=80=99t go, at any rate,=E2=80=99 said Alice: =E2=
=80=98besides, that=E2=80=99s not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s the oldest rule in the book,=E2=80=99 said the King.

=E2=80=98Then it ought to be Number One,=E2=80=99 said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. =E2=80=98Consider you=
r
verdict,=E2=80=99 he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

=E2=80=98There=E2=80=99s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,=E2=
=80=99 said the White
Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; =E2=80=98this paper has just been pick=
ed
up.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98What=E2=80=99s in it?=E2=80=99 said the Queen.

=E2=80=98I haven=E2=80=99t opened it yet,=E2=80=99 said the White Rabbit, =
=E2=80=98but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98It must have been that,=E2=80=99 said the King, =E2=80=98unless it=
 was written to
nobody, which isn=E2=80=99t usual, you know.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Who is it directed to?=E2=80=99 said one of the jurymen.

=E2=80=98It isn=E2=80=99t directed at all,=E2=80=99 said the White Rabbit; =
=E2=80=98in fact, there=E2=80=99s
nothing written on the OUTSIDE.=E2=80=99 He unfolded the paper as he spoke,=
 and
added =E2=80=98It isn=E2=80=99t a letter, after all: it=E2=80=99s a set of =
verses.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Are they in the prisoner=E2=80=99s handwriting?=E2=80=99 asked ano=
ther of the jurymen.

=E2=80=98No, they=E2=80=99re not,=E2=80=99 said the White Rabbit, =E2=80=98=
and that=E2=80=99s the queerest thing
about it.=E2=80=99 (The jury all looked puzzled.)

=E2=80=98He must have imitated somebody else=E2=80=99s hand,=E2=80=99 said =
the King. (The jury
all brightened up again.)

=E2=80=98Please your Majesty,=E2=80=99 said the Knave, =E2=80=98I didn=E2=
=80=99t write it, and they
can=E2=80=99t prove I did: there=E2=80=99s no name signed at the end.=E2=80=
=99

=E2=80=98If you didn=E2=80=99t sign it,=E2=80=99 said the King, =E2=80=98th=
at only makes the matter
worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you=E2=80=99d have signed=
 your
name like an honest man.=E2=80=99

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.

=E2=80=98That PROVES his guilt,=E2=80=99 said the Queen.

=E2=80=98It proves nothing of the sort!=E2=80=99 said Alice. =E2=80=98Why, =
you don=E2=80=99t even know
what they=E2=80=99re about!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Read them,=E2=80=99 said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. =E2=80=98Where shall I begin, pleas=
e
your Majesty?=E2=80=99 he asked.

=E2=80=98Begin at the beginning,=E2=80=99 the King said gravely, =E2=80=98a=
nd go on till you
come to the end: then stop.=E2=80=99

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--

   =E2=80=98They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
   She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

   He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
   If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

   I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
   They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

   If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
   He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

   My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
   An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

   Don=E2=80=99t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
   A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98That=E2=80=99s the most important piece of evidence we=E2=80=99ve =
heard yet,=E2=80=99 said the
King, rubbing his hands; =E2=80=98so now let the jury--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98If any one of them can explain it,=E2=80=99 said Alice, (she had g=
rown so large
in the last few minutes that she wasn=E2=80=99t a bit afraid of interruptin=
g
him,) =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99ll give him sixpence. _I_ don=E2=80=99t believe th=
ere=E2=80=99s an atom of
meaning in it.=E2=80=99

The jury all wrote down on their slates, =E2=80=98SHE doesn=E2=80=99t belie=
ve there=E2=80=99s an
atom of meaning in it,=E2=80=99 but none of them attempted to explain the p=
aper.

=E2=80=98If there=E2=80=99s no meaning in it,=E2=80=99 said the King, =E2=
=80=98that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn=E2=80=99t try to find any. And yet I don=E2=
=80=99t know,=E2=80=99
he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
with one eye; =E2=80=98I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. =E2=
=80=9C--SAID
I COULD NOT SWIM--=E2=80=9D you can=E2=80=99t swim, can you?=E2=80=99 he ad=
ded, turning to the
Knave.

The Knave shook his head sadly. =E2=80=98Do I look like it?=E2=80=99 he sai=
d. (Which he
certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)

=E2=80=98All right, so far,=E2=80=99 said the King, and he went on mutterin=
g over
the verses to himself: =E2=80=98=E2=80=9CWE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--=E2=80=9D t=
hat=E2=80=99s the jury, of
course--=E2=80=9CI GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--=E2=80=9D why, that mus=
t be what he
did with the tarts, you know--=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98But, it goes on =E2=80=9CTHEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,=E2=80=
=9D=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Why, there they are!=E2=80=99 said the King triumphantly, pointing=
 to the tarts
on the table. =E2=80=98Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--=E2=80=
=9CBEFORE SHE
HAD THIS FIT--=E2=80=9D you never had fits, my dear, I think?=E2=80=99 he s=
aid to the
Queen.

=E2=80=98Never!=E2=80=99 said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at =
the Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as
it lasted.)

=E2=80=98Then the words don=E2=80=99t FIT you,=E2=80=99 said the King, look=
ing round the court
with a smile. There was a dead silence.

=E2=80=98It=E2=80=99s a pun!=E2=80=99 the King added in an offended tone, a=
nd everybody laughed,
=E2=80=98Let the jury consider their verdict,=E2=80=99 the King said, for a=
bout the
twentieth time that day.

=E2=80=98No, no!=E2=80=99 said the Queen. =E2=80=98Sentence first--verdict =
afterwards.=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Stuff and nonsense!=E2=80=99 said Alice loudly. =E2=80=98The idea =
of having the
sentence first!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Hold your tongue!=E2=80=99 said the Queen, turning purple.

=E2=80=98I won=E2=80=99t!=E2=80=99 said Alice.

=E2=80=98Off with her head!=E2=80=99 the Queen shouted at the top of her vo=
ice. Nobody
moved.

=E2=80=98Who cares for you?=E2=80=99 said Alice, (she had grown to her full=
 size by this
time.) =E2=80=98You=E2=80=99re nothing but a pack of cards!=E2=80=99

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

=E2=80=98Wake up, Alice dear!=E2=80=99 said her sister; =E2=80=98Why, what =
a long sleep you=E2=80=99ve
had!=E2=80=99

=E2=80=98Oh, I=E2=80=99ve had such a curious dream!=E2=80=99 said Alice, an=
d she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
finished, her sister kissed her, and said, =E2=80=98It WAS a curious dream,
dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it=E2=80=99s getting late.=E2=
=80=99 So
Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.

But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her
wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
this was her dream:--

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
of her little sister=E2=80=99s dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess=E2=80=99s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard=E2=80=99s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pig=
s,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen=E2=80=99s shril=
l
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing
of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle=E2=80=
=99s
heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with
all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm=E2=80=99=
s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
